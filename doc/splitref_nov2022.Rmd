When screening for a systematic review or meta-analysis, we conduct several pilot screening rounds. Pilot screenings help us refine our search string, decision tree, and increase the overall accuracy of our screening^1^.

During a pilot screening, we want to select a random subset of references that would be a representative sample of the full set to determine whether our hit rate is sufficient. If possible, it is encouraged to work in collaboration with another reviewer during these rounds.

There are two reasons we'd want to automate the selection and splitting of a reference list:

1.  It is time consuming to randomly select papers (\>100 papers is tedious to select by hand!)

2.  We are not really good at selecting at random (actually computers aren't really good at being truly random either\*)

Below is the R ([www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/)) code to run two functions that may come in useful when conducting your pilot and collaborative screenings with Rayyan (<https://rayyan.ai/>), or any other software where you can upload your pilot reference list.

### 1. Select random pilot set:

First, load the `getpilotref` function below in your environment:

```{r}
# -----------------------------------
# getpilotref function 
# -----------------------------------
## Description: 
#     Function to obtain a random subset of references for pilot screening.
#
# Arguments
# - x: data frame with reference list
# - n: number of papers for pilot subset (default is 10)

getpilotref <- function(x, n=10, write=FALSE, fileName="pilot"){
  
  if (length(n) == 1L && n%%1==0 && n>0 && n<=nrow(x)) { 
    
    # sample randomly the vector n of row indexes and remove column in output dataset
    x$ids <- 1:nrow(x)
    pdat <- x[which(x$ids %in% sample(x$ids, n)),]
    pilot <- pdat[,-which(colnames(pdat)=="ids")]
    return(pilot)
    
    } else {
      # error message n value provided is not valid 
      stop("Incompatible value n supplied, please check. n must be a positive integer no higher than the total number of references provided.") 
    }
}
```

For the purpose of demonstration, load example reference list exported as a csv file from Rayyan:

```{r}
# Read example butterfly reference list
articles<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coraliewilliams/2022/main/data/articles_butterfly.csv")

```

First, let's obtain a random reference set of 10 papers without writing a csv file:

```{r}
p10 <- getpilotref(articles)
```

Now, let's obtain 100 papers and write the data frame of 100 as a csv file called "pilot100.csv":

```{r}
p100 <- getpilotref(articles, n=100, write=T, fileName="pilot100")
write_csv(pilot, paste(fileName, ".csv", sep=""), na="")
```

### 2. Split reference list with another collaborator

Load the `splitref_prop` function in your environment:

```{r}
# -----------------------------------
# splitref_prop function 
# -----------------------------------
## Description: 
#     Function to split in two a reference list based on input proportions.
#
## Arguments: 
# - x: data frame with reference list
# - p: vector of two numerical proportions for each split, it must have two positive numerical values that sum to 1.
# - write: logical argument whether to save the pilot list as csv in current working directory
# - fileName:  name to give to the suffix of the two split files. 

splitref_prop <- function(x, p=c(0.5, 0.5), fileName = "split", write = F) {
  
    if (length(p) == 2L && is.numeric(p) && sum(p) == 1 && all(p > 0)) {
      # get random list of indexes for each reference
      rids <- sample(1:nrow(x))
      
      # get index of row to split on using the first value of proportion of vector
      spl <- floor(p[-length(p)] * nrow(x))
      
      # get separate split data frame based on split ids indexes
      indx1 <- rids[1:spl]
      indx2 <- rids[(spl + 1):nrow(x)]
      
      # get separate datasets
      split1 <<- x[indx1,]
      split2 <<- x[indx2,]
      
      # print out message
      cat(paste(c("Reference list was randomly split into",length(p), "proportions of", p[1]*100, "% and", p[2]*100, "%")))
      
      if (write == T) {
        # save files
        write_csv(split1, paste(fileName, "_set1", ".csv", sep = ""), na ="")
        write_csv(split2, paste(fileName, "_set2", ".csv", sep = ""), na ="")
        
        # print out summary of splitting and data files saved
        p <- ifelse(length(prop) == 1, "equal", "unequal")
        cat(paste(c("\n",k,"files were saved:\n",paste(getwd(), "/", fileName, "_set1", ".csv", sep = ""))))
        
      }
  
    } else {
      # error message if provided n value is not valid
      stop("Incompatible values for p (proportions) supplied, please check.
           Proportion values must be positive integers less than 1, and the total sum of all proportions should equal to 1.")
    }
}

```

Work on more functionalities (e.g. split between multiple collaborators) is upcoming... Any comments, questions or feedback, please contact me at [coralie.williams\@unsw.edu.au](mailto:coralie.williams@unsw.edu.au){.email}

\*most often random number generators produced by computers are "pseudo-random", meaning they are produced from a deterministic mathematical model. These pseudo-random numbers are usually good (and better than what any human replicate). In statistics, a selection process is random if each item of a set has an equal probability of being chosen.

There exist true random number generators based . If you're curious check out these websites: <https://www.random.org/>; <https://qrng.anu.edu.au/random-colours/>
