However, this ability comes with the disadvantage that they can only be applied to new data if these are similar to the training data. Since spatial mapping requires predictions to new geographic space which in many cases goes along with new predictor properties, a method to assess the area to which a prediction model can be reliably applied is required. Here, we suggest a methodology that delineates the 'area of applicability' (AOA) that we define as the area where we enabled the model to learn about relationships based on the training data, and where the estimated cross-validation performance holds. We first propose a 'dissimilarity index' (DI) that is based on the minimum distance to the training data in the multidimensional predictor space, with predictors being weighted by their respective importance in the model. The AOA is then derived by applying a threshold which is the (outlier-removed) maximum DI of the training data derived via cross-validation. We further use the relationship between the DI and the cross-validation performance to map the estimated performance of predictions. We illustrate the approach in a simulated case study chosen to mimic ecological realities and test the credibility by using a large set of simulated data. The simulation studies showed that the prediction error within the AOA is comparable to the cross-validation error of the trained model, while the cross-validation error does not apply outside the AOA. This applies to models being trained with randomly distributed training data, as well as when training data are clustered in space and where spatial cross-validation is applied. Using the relationship between DI and cross-validation performance showed potential to limit predictions to the area where a user-defined performance applies. We suggest to add the AOA computation to the modeller's standard toolkit and to present predictions for the AOA only. We further suggest to report a map of DI-dependent performance estimates alongside prediction maps and complementary to (cross-)validation performance measures and the common uncertainty estimates.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  31     Total Times Cited:  31     Cited Reference Count:  47,10.1111/2041-210X.13650,machine learning;model transferability;predictive modelling;Random Forest;remote sensing;spatial mapping;uncertainty;CROSS-VALIDATION;PERFORMANCE;UNCERTAINTY;STRATEGIES;ACCURACY;FOREST;DOMAIN;RANGE;BIAS,,

Yet, confidence interval approaches for this metric are scarce and poorly evaluated. In this paper, we compare 13 methods that can be used to construct simultaneous confidence intervals for selection ratios. Seven of the methods are applicable when availabilities are unknown. These are bootstrapping and six methods adapted from relative risk (Katz-log, adjusted-log, Bailey, inverse hyperbolic sine, Koopman and Noether). The other six approaches are applicable when availabilities are known. These are bootstrapping, two existing methods for relative risk (Wald-adjusted, Noether-fixed) and three straightforward new methods (fixed-log, Agresti-Coull-adjusted and Bayes-beta). None of the 13 approaches have been previously evaluated in the context of selection ratios. In simulations with unknown availabilities, the Koopman method performed best, and the currently recommended Noether method performed worst. In simulations with fixed availabilities, the new Agresti-Coull-adjusted, fixed-log, Bayes-beta methods all outperformed the currently recommended Wald-adjusted method. In the context of real ecological data sets, the Noether and Wald-adjusted methods produced anomalous results that putatively would alter management decisions. We note that our findings, including those for new methods, are directly conferrable to relative risk, allowing extension of our work to the many branches of biology that rely on this measure. The poor performance of the Noether and Wald-adjusted methods is troubling because these are currently the most widely used procedures for calculating confidence intervals for type I resource-selection designs. Based on our findings, we recommend that the Noether method be replaced with the Koopman method, and the Wald-adjusted method be replaced with the Agresti-Coull-adjusted method.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  70,10.1111/2041-210X.12304     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),selection ratio;ratio of multinomial proportions;relative risk;resource selection;confidence interval;Bayesian;Credible interval;HABITAT USE;ALASKAN MOOSE;HOME-RANGE;LIMITS;TESTS;SCALE;APPROXIMATE;PARAMETERS;ABUNDANCE;RESPONSES;Confidence Intervals,,

Estimators differed greatly in precision in the scenarios examined, and a widely employed (N-e) over cap estimator exhibited the largest variances among replicate data sets.

A general indexing paradigm was developed for structuring data collection and validly conducting analyses. This approach is applicable for many observation metrics, with observations made at stations through the area of interest and repeated over several days. The variance formula for the general index was derived using a linear mixed model, with statistical tests and confidence intervals constructed assuming Gaussian-distributed observations. However, many observation methods, like intrusions to track plots or camera traps, involve counts with many zeroes, producing Poisson like observations. To fill this inferential gap between Gaussian analytical assumptions and Poisson-distributed data we evaluated, via a broad Monte Carlo simulation study, variance estimation and confidence interval coverage when Gaussian statistical inference is applied to data generated from a Poisson distribution. The mixed effects linear model assuming Gaussian observations performed well in estimating variances and confidence intervals when simulated Poisson data were in the range found in field studies (88-96% confidence interval coverage). Estimation improved by increasing the number of observation days. Confidence interval coverage rates performed very well (even with few observation days) when day-to-day variability was small, while effective estimation resulted fora great range in station-to-station variability. These results provide a foundational basis for applying the general indexing paradigm to count data, strengthen the generality of the approach, provide valuable information for study design, and should reassure practitioners about the validity of their analytical inferences when using count data.

The merit of the metric is that it identifies commonly available resources that are nonetheless critical components in the ecology of an organism. Such resources would not be identified as being selected in comparisons of use relative to availability (e.g., use/availability). Importance values have received limited use in the ecological literature because they have been descriptive in nature and lack a framework for hypothesis testing. In this paper we present a simple asymptotic one- and two-tailed method for calculating confidence intervals for the product of proportions. The approach is easily extended to importance values. Results from simulations indicate that our method is effective across a wide range of sample sizes, but performs poorly when designs are unbalanced. As a result, we recommend rarifying availability data in matched-case designs for determining resource selection, before calculating confidence intervals for importance values. Applications of our method extend beyond the calculation of confidence intervals for importance values.

Researchers typically sum over the straight-line displacements (SLDs) between sampled locations to quantify distance traveled, while speed is estimated by dividing these displacements by time. Problematically, this approach is highly sensitive to the measurement scale, with biases subject to the sampling frequency, the tortuosity of the animal's movement, and the amount of measurement error. Compounding the issue of scale-sensitivity, SLD estimates do not come equipped with confidence intervals to quantify their uncertainty. Methods To overcome the limitations of SLD estimation, we outline a continuous-time speed and distance (CTSD) estimation method. An inherent property of working in continuous-time is the ability to separate the underlying continuous-time movement process from the discrete-time sampling process, making these models less sensitive to the sampling schedule when estimating parameters. The first step of CTSD is to estimate the device's error parameters to calibrate the measurement error. Once the errors have been calibrated, model selection techniques are employed to identify the best fit continuous-time movement model for the data. A simulation-based approach is then employed to sample from the distribution of trajectories conditional on the data, from which the mean speed estimate and its confidence intervals can be extracted. Results Using simulated data, we demonstrate how CTSD provides accurate, scale-insensitive estimates with reliable confidence intervals. When applied to empirical GPS data, we found that SLD estimates varied substantially with sampling frequency, whereas CTSD provided relatively consistent estimates, with often dramatic improvements over SLD. Conclusions The methods described in this study allow for the computationally efficient, scale-insensitive estimation of speed and distance traveled, without biases due to the sampling frequency, the tortuosity of the animal's movement, or the amount of measurement error. In addition to being robust to the sampling schedule, the point estimates come equipped with confidence intervals, permitting formal statistical inference.

Problems arise with non-spatial estimators when individuals differ in their exposure to traps or the target population is poorly defined. Spatially explicit capturerecapture (SECR) methods devised recently to estimate population density largely avoid these problems. Some applications require estimates of population size rather than density, and population size in a defined area may be obtained as a derived parameter from SECR models. While this use of SECR has potential benefits over conventional capturerecapture, including reduced bias, it is unfamiliar to field biologists and no study has examined the precision and robustness of the estimates. We used simulation to compare the performance of SECR and conventional estimators of population size with respect to bias and confidence interval coverage for several spatial scenarios. Three possible estimators for the sampling variance of realised population size all performed well. The precision of SECR estimates was nearly the same as that of the null-model conventional population estimator. SECR estimates of population size were nearly unbiased (relative bias 010%) in all scenarios, including surveys in randomly generated patchy landscapes. Confidence interval coverage was near the nominal level. We used SECR to estimate the population of a species of skink Oligosoma infrapunctatum from pitfall trapping. The estimated number in the area bounded by the outermost traps differed little between a homogeneous density model and models with a quadratic trend in density or a habitat effect on density, despite evidence that the latter models fitted better. Extrapolation of trend models to a larger plot may be misleading.

Our sampling effort was not sufficient to provide reliable inference for monitoring projects. Therefore, we used our field results to structure a simulation study to compare the performance of plot-based and distance sampling estimators of density. These 2 methods have different assumptions: plot sampling assumes a perfect detection of animals within the surveyed plots, whereas distance sampling assumes a decrease in detectability as the distance between observer and animal increases. The density and the detectability conditions adopted in the simulation were designed to be similar to those observed in our 2 studies, whereas the spatial patterns presumed for the simulated populations described a wide range of possible scenarios. Sampling points were allocated according to both random and stratified distributions. Simulation results showed that plot sampling underestimated density with bias invariably greater than 30% and confidence intervals with coverage lower than the nominal level of 95%. Conversely, distance sampling estimators provided bias levels invariably smaller than those obtained using plot sampling and bootstrap confidence intervals with empirical coverage near to or greater than 95%. Based on our simulations, the distance sampling estimator was superior to the plot sampling estimator for these grouse species on our study areas in terms of precision and accuracy and the stratified allocation was superior to the random allocation.

Based on simulations, we illustrate some of the underlying motivations. First, p-values vary strongly from study to study, hence dichotomous inference using significance thresholds is usually unjustified. Second, 'statistically significant' results have overestimated effect sizes, a bias declining with increasing statistical power. Third, 'statistically non-significant' results have underestimated effect sizes, and this bias gets stronger with higher statistical power. Fourth, the tested statistical hypotheses usually lack biological justification and are often uninformative. Despite these problems, a screen of 48 papers from the 2020 volume of the Journal of Evolutionary Biology exemplifies that significance testing is still used almost universally in evolutionary biology. All screened studies tested default null hypotheses of zero effect with the default significance threshold of p = 0.05, none presented a pre-specified alternative hypothesis, pre-study power calculation and the probability of 'false negatives' (beta error rate). The results sections of the papers presented 49 significance tests on average (median 23, range 0-390). Of 41 studies that contained verbal descriptions of a 'statistically non-significant' result, 26 (63%) falsely claimed the absence of an effect. We conclude that studies in ecology and evolutionary biology are mostly exploratory and descriptive. We should thus shift from claiming to 'test' specific hypotheses statistically to describing and discussing many hypotheses (possible true effect sizes) that are most compatible with our data, given our statistical model. We already have the means for doing so, because we routinely present compatibility ('confidence') intervals covering these hypotheses.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  87,10.1111/jeb.14009,compatibility interval;effect size;null hypothesis;p-value;scientific method;statistical inference;P-VALUES;CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS;SCIENCE;HYPOTHESIS;STATISTICS;GUIDELINES;FRAMEWORK;POWER,,

The ability to measure the statistical power of these methods has become crucial to ensure that data quantity keeps pace with growing model complexity. Through simulations, we show that commonly applied model choice methods based on information criteria can have remarkably high error rates; this can be a problem because methods to estimate the uncertainty or power are not widely known or applied. Furthermore, the power of comparative methods can depend significantly on the structure of the data. We describe a Monte Carlo-based method which addresses both of these challenges, and show how this approach both quantifies and substantially reduces errors relative to information criteria.

We illustrate how the power to distinguish different models, such as varying levels of selection, varies both with number of taxa and structure of the phylogeny.

These frequentist methods calculate the chance of not having seen a species lately given that it is still alive (a conditional probability). However, any reasonable person would instead want to know the chance that a species is extinct given that it has not been seen (the posterior probability). Here, I present a simple Bayesian equation that estimates posteriors. It uninterestingly assumes that the sampling probability equals the frequency of sightings within the range. It interestingly sets the prior probability of going extinct during any one time interval (E) by assuming that extinction is an exponential decay process and there is a 50% chance a species has gone extinct by the end of its observed range. The range is first adjusted for undersampling by using a routine equation. Bayes' theorem is then used to compute the posterior for interval 1 (epsilon(1)), which becomes the prior for interval 2. The following posterior epsilon(2) again incorporates E because extinction might have happened instead during interval 2. The posteriors are called ""creeping-shadow-of-a-doubt values"" to emphasize the uniquely iterative nature of the calculation. Simulations show that the method is highly accurate and precise given moderate to high sampling probabilities and otherwise conservative, robust to random variation in sampling, and able to detect extinction pulses after a short lag. Improving the method by having it consider clustering of sightings makes it highly resilient to trends in sampling. Example calculations involving recently extinct Costa Rican frogs and Maastrichtian ammonites show that the method helps to evaluate the status of critically endangered species and identify species likely to have gone extinct below some stratigraphic horizon.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  20     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  43,10.1666/13074     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS;RECORDS;Bayes Theorem,,

Typically, the discrimination capacity of the models, that is, how good the instances of presence and absence are correctly classified, is assessed with statistics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). However, the value of any discrimination statistic depends on the distribution of the suitability scores in the evaluation dataset, the so-called representativeness effect. For example, the same well-calibrated model evaluated with two datasets, one set with mostly intermediate predicted values (around 0.5) and another set in which most cases have extreme predicted values (close to 0 and close to 1), will yield low (towards 0.5) and high (towards 1) AUC values, respectively. Thus, discrimination values are entirely context dependent and cannot be directly compare between datasets because they are not intrinsic measures of a model's performance. In this contribution, I propose a methodology based on stratified bootstrapping with an inverse probability weighting that makes the distribution of the suitability values uniform and harmonizes the AUC so that the so-called uAUC can now be compared between different datasets. I run simulations considering a range of sample sizes and different initial distributions of the suitability values to validate the method. I apply the method to an empirical exercise, and implement it in the R package vandalico. Although I mainly focused on the AUC, the harmonization procedure can be applied to any other discrimination measure that is prevalence independent in a strict mathematical sense, such as the sensitivity star (Se*). To provide accurate estimations, it is important to have a high-quality evaluation dataset, that is, a dataset that covers the whole spectrum of suitability values and a minimum sample size of at least 150 cases. Further research is needed to develop a method to estimate reliable confidence intervals.

Therefore, more accurate and efficient methods are necessary for water quality assessment. Although Bayesian methods are widely used in water quality modelling and uncertainty analyses, the algorithm efficiency often limits their application in multi-parameter eutrophication models. In this study, a genetic algorithm was integrated into a Bayesian method to improve sampling performance during the parameter calibration process. An eutrophication model of an urban lake in north China (Tianjin) is established based on biological processes and external loads. A Markov chain Monte Carlo method coupled with a genetic algorithm (MCMC-GA) is developed to sample the posterior parameter distributions and calculate the simulation results. Then, the performances of the MCMC-GA and classical MCMC are compared and analyzed. Finally, a water quality assessment is conducted for eutrophication management. The results are as follows: (1) the MCMC-GA displays a better convergence efficiency during parameter sampling, higher Markov chain quality, and narrower 95% upper and lower confidence intervals than the classical MCMC method; and (2) rainwater runoff nutrient loading must be controlled for urban lake restoration.

Camera trapping plays an important role in wildlife surveys, and provides valuable information for estimation of population density. While mark-recapture techniques can estimate population density for species that can be individually recognized or marked, there are no robust methods to estimate density of species that cannot be individually identified. 2. We developed a new approach to estimate population density based on the simulation of individual movement within the camera grid. Simulated animals followed a correlated random walk with the movement parameters of segment length, angular deflection, movement distance and home-range size derived from empirical movement paths. Movement was simulated under a series of population densities. We used the Random Forest algorithm to determine the population density with the highest likelihood of matching the camera trap data. We developed an R package, cameratrapR, to conduct simulations and estimate population density. 3. Compared with line transect surveys and the random encounter model, cameratrapR provides more reliable estimates of wildlife density with narrower confidence intervals. Functions are provided to visualize movement paths, derive movement parameters, and plot camera trapping results. 4.

Nowadays, screening genetic databases for related individuals forms an important aspect of standard quality control procedures. Relatedness research is usually based on an allele sharing analysis of identity by state (IBS) or identity by descent (IBD) alleles. Existing IBS/IBD methods mainly aim to identify first-degree relationships (parent-offspring or full siblings) and second degree (half-siblings, avuncular, or grandparent-grandchild) pairs. Little attention has been paid to the detection of in-between first and second-degree relationships such as three-quarter siblings (3/4S) who share fewer alleles than first-degree relationships but more alleles than second-degree relationships. With the progressively increasing sample sizes used in genetic research, it becomes more likely that such relationships are present in the database under study. In this paper, we extend existing likelihood ratio (LR) methodology to accurately infer the existence of 3/4S, distinguishing them from full siblings and second-degree relatives. We use bootstrap confidence intervals to express uncertainty in the LRs. Our proposal accounts for linkage disequilibrium (LD) by using marker pruning, and we validate our methodology with a pedigree-based simulation study accounting for both LD and recombination.

Recently, Baker and King (2010, King and Baker 2010) proposed a method, threshold indicator analysis (TITAN), to calculate species and community thresholds based on indicator species scores adapted from Dufrene and Legendre (1997). We tested the ability of TITAN to detect thresholds using models with (broken-stick, disjointed broken-stick, dose-response, step-function, Gaussian) and without (linear) definitive thresholds. TITAN accurately and consistently detected thresholds in step-function models, but not in models characterized by abrupt changes in response slopes or response direction. Threshold detection in TITAN was very sensitive to the distribution of 0 values, which caused TITAN to identify thresholds associated with relatively small differences in the distribution of 0 values while ignoring thresholds associated with large changes in abundance. Threshold identification and tests of statistical significance were based on the same data permutations resulting in inflated estimates of statistical significance. Application of bootstrapping to the split-point problem that underlies TITAN led to underestimates of the confidence intervals of thresholds. Bias in the derivation of the z-scores used to identify TITAN thresholds and skewedness in the distribution of data along the gradient produced TITAN thresholds that were much more similar than the actual thresholds. This tendency may account for the synchronicity of thresholds reported in TITAN analyses. The thresholds identified by TITAN represented disparate characteristics of species responses that, when coupled with the inability of TITAN to identify thresholds accurately and consistently, does not support the aggregation of individual species thresholds into a community threshold.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  24,10.1899/12-056.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),benthic macroinvertebrates;change point;indicator species scores;management threshold;simulation;threshold;ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY THRESHOLDS;CATCHMENT URBANIZATION;MANAGEMENT;IDENTIFICATION;ASSEMBLAGES;BREAKPOINTS,,

However, the performance (i.e., relative root mean squared error [RRMSE], confidence interval coverage, relative bias and relative standard error) of clustered detector arrays has not been thoroughly evaluated. I used simulations to evaluate the performance of various detector and cluster spacings, cluster configurations (i.e., number of detectors arranged in a square grid), sampling extents and number of sampling occasions for estimating population density, the relationship between detection rate and distance to a detector from the animal's center of activity (sigma) and base detection rates, using American black bears (Ursus americanus) as a case study. My simulations indicated that a wide range of detector configurations can provide reliable estimates if spacing between detectors in clusters is 1 sigma and 3 sigma. A number of cluster configurations and occasion lengths produced estimates that were unbiased, resulted in good spatial coverage, and were relatively precise. Moreover, increasing the duration of sampling, establishing large study areas, increasing detection rates and spacing clusters so that cross-cluster sampling of individuals can occur could help ameliorate deficiencies in the detector layout. These results have application for a wide array of species and sampling methods (e.g., DNA sampling, camera trapping, mark-resight and search-encounter) and suggest that clustered sampling can significantly reduce the effort necessary to provide reliable estimates of population density across large spatial extents that previously would have been infeasible with nonclustered sampling designs.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  22     Total Times Cited:  22     Cited Reference Count:  35,10.1002/1438-390X.1011     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),bear;cluster;density;mark-recapture;simulation;spatially explicit;Ursus;BLACK BEAR POPULATION;MARK-RECAPTURE;GENETIC DIVERSITY;CAMERA TRAPS;CAPTURE;SIZE;DEMOGRAPHY;RIVER;Population Density,,

Genetic monitoring can be an effective approach for acquiring this important demographic information when traditional methods are unsuccessful, inefficient, or too expensive. This study demonstrates a novel application of genetic data opportunistically collected from harvested game to estimate a minimum annual count of breeding packs of gray wolves (Canis lupus) and to provide a coarse index of harvest vulnerability of young of the year (YOY) across packs. We used 18 microsatellite loci to genotype 98 gray wolf YOY from 2014 and 105 from 2015 harvested in Idaho, USA. Using this genotype data, we reconstructed sibling groups for each cohort using the program COLONY and treated full-sibling litters as proxies for unique packs. In addition to evaluating our marker panel using simulations, we assessed the accuracy of empirical relationship assignments by adding YOY of known relationship from long-term study packs to the dataset (27 individuals from 2014 and 61 from 2015) and tracking correctly reconstructed relationships. We varied COLONY input parameters to evaluate the power of relationship assignments under conditions that may be encountered when working with empirical data. We also compared COLONY's estimates of effective number of breeders based on sibship frequency to estimates based on a commonly used linkage-disequilibrium method. All COLONY runs for both cohorts correctly identified the known sibling relationships. Among the other individuals, changes in the geographic clustering of putative siblings, probabilities of inclusion and exclusion for reconstructed sibling groups, and consistency of relationship assignments across COLONY runs suggested that marker number had a larger effect on accuracy than access to population-level genetic data. Our estimates of breeding packs subjected to harvest within the state (52 for 2014 and 63 for 2015) differed from estimates reported by Idaho Department of Fish and Game by <= 6 for both years. Among packs that had pups harvested, most packs had 1-2 YOY harvested, whereas other packs had as many as 5 YOY harvested. All estimates of the number of effective breeders had overlapping confidence intervals regardless of method, though sibship frequency-based estimates had larger confidence intervals than estimates using the linkage disequilibrium method. Our study shows that sibling relationships can be accurately and reliably reconstructed from harvested gray wolves, and demonstrates a valuable new use of samples collected through harvest.

To investigate the causes and to examine the underlying mechanisms, a two-dimensional uncertainty eutrophication model was developed. The model reflected the interactions between nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton. Moreover, it can be utilized to describe seasonal and regional water quality changes. The two-dimensional hydraulic model was set up using Navier-Stokes equations and was calculated by applying the finite volume method. The Bayesian method was employed to calibrate the model parameters and obtain the parameter posterior distribution. The two-dimensional hydraulic information and the parameter posterior distribution were utilized to calculate a two-dimensional uncertainty eutrophication model, for which the 95% confidence interval (uncertainty bounds which can provide the trend and range for water quality changes) and mean value of every water quality index (nitrate, ammonia, phosphate, Chl. a and dissolved oxygen) were simulated. Comparisons between the model simulations and the field data indicated that the models were able to calculate the hydrodynamic information and the eutrophication dynamics with reasonable accuracy (all the relative errors lower than 11%). The simulated concentrations of water quality indexes (nitrate, ammonia, phosphate and Chl. a.) in the vicinity of the lake were higher than that in the middle of the lake during the simulation period, indicating that the nutrient load of the rainwater runoff had significant impacts on algal blooms and water quality. Therefore, the urban lake was vulnerable to the influence of rainwater runoff. To reduce the eutrophication risk, rainwater runoff needs to be controlled. Two-dimensional uncertainty eutrophication models, such as those used in this study, can provide a powerful management tool that will continue to improve prediction reliability.

This assumption influences management focused on simulation of natural disturbance dynamics and is embedded in most models of forest successional dynamics. We use multi-decade monitoring of permanent plots in old-growth forests to assess demographic assumptions directly with respect to tree mortality rates.        Location Sixteen sites in mesic, temperate old-growth forests in eastern North America and Europe with multi-decade monitoring.        Time period Variable across sites, spanning c. 20-78 years from 1936 to 2014.        Major taxa studied Tree species of late-successional, cool-temperate forests of Europe and eastern North America.        Methods We calculated and compared the annualized mortality rates (m), with confidence intervals, by species, size class and measurement interval, for tree species of sufficient abundance.        Results Retrospective analysis shows dynamic and diverse demographic properties across populations and sites. Stand-scale mortality rates of 0.7-2.5%/year average higher than previous estimates for old-growth temperate forests. Variations among species, over time and among size classes, suggest that gap-phase models are inadequate to explain stand dynamics, implying instead that rare disturbance events of moderate severity have long-lasting effects in old-growth forests and that indirect anthropogenic influences affect old-growth, unlogged forests.        Main conclusions Multi-decade baseline data, essential for understanding community assembly and long-term dynamics in these ""slow systems,"" are rare and poorly integrated. Our analysis demonstrates the value of the few long-term, ""legacy"" data sets. Results suggest that differences in life history interact with complex disturbance histories, resulting in non-equilibrial dynamics in old-growth temperate tree communities, and that changes in disturbance patterns through anthropogenic climate change might, therefore, be an important driver of ecosystem change.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  108,10.1111/geb.13291,long&#8208;term studies;old&#8208;growth forest;permanent plots;temperate forest;tree mortality rates;North America;Europe;Trees,,

The posterior distribution for extinction time is evaluated using the likelihood of sighting data and non-informative priors for model parameters. All the models discussed in this paper are implemented in JAGS, a program for analysing Bayesian models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. A general methodology is presented and then applied to the sighting record of the ivory-billed woodpecker (IBW)Campephilus principalis. It was found that the IBW most likely went extinct between 1940 and 1945, a little after the date of the last certain sighting. The methods developed were also applied to other species sighting records as well as some artificial sighting records.

Therefore, spatial analyses of multilocus genotypes may offer a powerful approach for detecting sex-biased dispersal in natural populations. However, the effects of sex-biased dispersal on fine-scale genetic structure have not been explored. We used simulations and multilocus spatial autocorrelation analysis to investigate how sex-biased dispersal influences fine-scale genetic structure. We evaluated three statistical tests for detecting sex-biased dispersal: bootstrap confidence intervals about autocorrelation r values and recently developed heterogeneity tests at the distance class and whole correlogram levels. Even modest sex bias in dispersal resulted in significantly different fine-scale spatial autocorrelation patterns between the sexes. This was particularly evident when dispersal was strongly restricted in the less-dispersing sex (mean distance <200 m), when differences between the sexes were readily detected over short distances. All tests had high power to detect sex-biased dispersal with large sample sizes (n = 250). However, there was variation in type I error rates among the tests, for which we offer specific recommendations. We found congruence between simulation predictions and empirical data from the agile antechinus, a species that exhibits male-biased dispersal, confirming the power of individual-based genetic analysis to provide insights into asymmetries in male and female dispersal. Our key recommendations for using multilocus spatial autocorrelation analyses to test for sex-biased dispersal are: (i) maximize sample size, not locus number; (ii) concentrate sampling within the scale of positive structure; (iii) evaluate several distance class sizes; (iv) use appropriate methods when combining data from multiple populations; (v) compare the appropriate groups of individuals.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  146     Total Times Cited:  148     Cited Reference Count:  42,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05485.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Antechinus;fine-scale genetic structure;heterogeneity testing;sex-biased dispersal;simulation;spatial autocorrelation;FORESTRY PLANTATION ESTABLISHMENT;HABITAT FRAGMENTATION;RELATEDNESS STRUCTURE;POPULATION-STRUCTURE;MARSUPIAL CARNIVORE;NATAL DISPERSAL;ANTECHINUS;PHILOPATRY;UNGULATE;FLOW;Bias (Epidemiology),,

We used computer simulations to quantify bias and precision of the one-sample LDNe estimator of N-b in age-structured populations using a range of published species life history types, sample sizes, and DNA markers. N-b estimates were biased by similar to 5%-10% when using SNPs or microsatellites in species ranging from fishes to mosquitoes, frogs, and seaweed. The bias (high or low) was similar for different life history types within a species suggesting that life history variation in populations will not influence N-b estimation. Precision was higher for 100 SNPs (H approximate to 0.30) than for 15 microsatellites (H approximate to 0.70). Confidence intervals (CIs) were occasionally too narrow, and biased high when N-b was small (N-b < 50); however, the magnitude of bias would unlikely influence management decisions. The CIs (from LDNe) were sufficiently narrow to achieve high statistical power (>= 0.80) to reject the null hypothesis that N-b = 50 when the true N-b = 30 and when sampling 50 individuals and 200 SNPs. Similarly, CIs were sufficiently narrow to reject N-b = 500 when the true N-b = 400 and when sampling 200 individuals and 5,000 loci.

We performed forward simulations of diploid populations at increasing rates of clonality (c), analysed their relationships with genotypic (clonal richness, R, and distribution of clonal sizes, Pareto beta) and genetic (F-IS and linkage disequilibrium) indices, and tested predictions of c from population genetic data through supervised machine learning. Two complementary behaviours emerged from the probability distributions of genotypic and genetic indices with increasing c. While the impact of c on R and Pareto beta was easily described by simple mathematical equations, its effects on genetic indices were noticeable only at the highest levels (c > 0.95). Consequently, genotypic indices allowed reliable estimates of c, while genetic descriptors led to poorer performances when c < 0.95. These results provide clear baseline expectations for genotypic and genetic diversity and dynamics under partial clonality. Worryingly, however, the use of realistic sample sizes to acquire empirical data systematically led to gross underestimates (often of one to two orders of magnitude) of c, suggesting that many interpretations hitherto proposed in the literature, mostly based on genotypic richness, should be reappraised.

We propose two new target functions based on TPL and attempt to more accurately estimate the model parameter(s). By capturing the mean-variance relationship, the accuracy of parameter estimation and the power of hypothesis testing are improved compared to the traditional methods which assume homogeneous variance. Five approaches, including ordinary least squares (OLS), chi-squared (chi(2)), weighted least squares (WLS), psi-squared (psi(2)) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), are compared under both linear and nonlinear scenarios regarding the prediction accuracy using both computer simulations and experimental data. We further simulate irregular measurements on the predictors to examine the robustness of parameter estimation. In computer simulations, psi-squared, WLS, and MLE outperform OLS and chi-squared with respect to parameter estimation. In the simulation study of irregular measurements, psi-squared and MLE outperform WLS when the sample mean is smaller than the population mean. On the other hand, WLS outperforms psi-squared and MLE when the sample mean is larger than the population mean. Psi-squared has an advantage over MLE when large irregular deviations are present. This study strongly suggests using psi-squared and WLS in place of OLS or chi-squared for both linear and nonlinear regressions, the choice of method depending on the observations.

Rapid and inexpensive index calibration survey (ICS) methods have been developed to monitor large African carnivores. ICS methods assume constant detection probability and a predictable relationship between the index and the actual population of interest. The precision and utility of the resulting estimates from ICS methods have been questioned. We assessed the performance of one ICS method for large carnivores-track counts-with data from two long-term studies of African lion populations. We conducted Monte Carlo simulation of intersections between transects (road segments) and lion movement paths (from GPS collar data) at varying survey intensities. Then, using the track count method we estimated population size and its confidence limits. We found that estimates either overstate precision or are too imprecise to be meaningful. Overstated precision stemmed from discarding the variance from population estimates when developing the method and from treating the conversion from tracks counts to population density as a back-transformation, rather than applying the equation for the variance of a linear function. To effectively assess the status of species, the IUCN has set guidelines, and these should be integrated in survey designs. We propose reporting the half relative confidence interval width (HRCIW) as an easily calculable and interpretable measure of precision. We show that track counts do not adhere to IUCN criteria, and we argue that ICS methods for wide-ranging low-density species are unlikely to meet those criteria. Established, intensive methods lead to precise estimates, but some new approaches, like short, intensive, (spatial) capture-mark-recapture (CMR/SECR) studies, aided by camera trapping and/or genetic identification of individuals, hold promise.

Averaging across loci as if they were independent creates pseudoreplication, which reduces the effective degrees of freedom (df') compared to the nominal degrees of freedom, df.

Here, we measured pseudoreplication (quantified by the ratio df'/df) for a common metric of genetic differentiation (F-ST) and a common measure of linkage disequilibrium between pairs of loci (r(2)). Based on data simulated using models (SLiM and msprime) that allow efficient forward-in-time and coalescent simulations while precisely controlling population pedigrees, we estimated df' and df'/df by measuring the rate of decline in the variance of mean F-ST and mean r(2) as more loci were used. For both indices, df' increases with N-e and genome size, as expected. However, even for large N-e and large genomes, df' for mean r(2) plateaus after a few thousand loci, and a variance components analysis indicates that the limiting factor is uncertainty associated with sampling individuals rather than genes. Pseudoreplication is less extreme for F-ST, but df'/df <= 0.01 can occur in data sets using tens of thousands of loci. Commonly-used block-jackknife methods consistently overestimated var (F-ST), producing very conservative confidence intervals.

Presence/absence (P/A) sampling may have advantages over plant cover assessments for reducing such errors. However, the linking between P/A data and plant density depends on model assumptions for plant spatial distributions. Previous studies have shown, for example, how that plant density can be estimated under Poisson model assumptions on the plant locations. In this study, new methods are developed and evaluated for linking P/A data with plant density assuming that plants occur in clustered spatial patterns.        New theory was derived for estimating plant density under Neyman-Scott-type cluster models such as the Matern and Thomas cluster processes. Suggested estimators, corresponding confidence intervals and a proposed goodness-of-fit test were evaluated in a Monte Carlo simulation study assuming a Matern cluster process. Furthermore, the estimators were applied to plant data from environmental monitoring in Sweden to demonstrate their empirical application.        The simulation study showed that our methods work well for large enough sample sizes. The judgment of what is' large enough' is often difficult, but simulations indicate that a sample size is large enough when the sampling distributions of the parameter estimators are symmetric or mildly skewed. Bootstrap may be used to check whether this is true. The empirical results suggest that the derived methodology may be useful for estimating density of plants such as Leucanthemum vulgare and Scorzonera humilis.        By developing estimators of plant density from P/A data under realistic model assumptions about plants' spatial distributions, P/A sampling will become a more useful tool for inventories of plant populations.

Applying phylogeny-based analyses of trait evolution and diversification in the fossil record generally involves transforming an unscaled cladogram into a phylogeny scaled to geologic time. Current methods produce single time-scaled phylogenies with no indication of the uncertainty in the temporal relationships and, under some methods, artificial zero-length branches.        2. Here, I present a stochastic algorithm for time-scaling phylogenies of fossil taxa by randomly sampling node ages from a constrained distribution, with the ultimate goal of producing large samples of time-scaled phylogenies for a given data set as the basis for phylogeny-based analyses. I describe how this stochastic approach can be extended to consider potential ancestral relationships and resolve polytomies.        3. The stochastic selection of node ages in this algorithm is weighted by the probability density of the total inferable unobserved evolutionary history at single divergence events in a tree, a distribution dependent on rates of branching, extinction and sampling in the fossil record.        4. The combined time-scaling method must be calibrated with explicit estimates of three rates: branching, extinction and sampling, and thus is named the cal3 time-scaling method, included in the r library paleotree. I test the time-scaling capabilities of the cal3 and older time-scaling methods in simulations. cal3 produces samples of time-scaled trees that better bracket the uncertainty in the true node ages than existing time-scaling methods. This is true even in simulations under a terminal-taxon' model of differentiation that violates many of the assumptions of the cal3 method.        5. The cal3 method provides a new approach for time-scaling palaeontological cladograms, calibrated to estimated sampling and diversification rates, allowing for better estimates of uncertainty in the phylogenetic time-scaling. The cal3 method is robust to relaxation of at least some model assumptions. Additional work is needed to analyse the impact of time-scaling approaches on macroevolutionary analyses and to integrate time-scaling with phylogenetic inference.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  84     Total Times Cited:  84     Cited Reference Count:  40,10.1111/2041-210X.12081     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),cladistics;comparative methods;diversification;extinct lineages;fossil time-trees;incomplete sampling;palaeontology;CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS;BODY-SIZE;EVOLUTIONARY;RECORD;PROBABILITY;RADIATION;ORIGINS;Calibration,,

However, this model, derived from the negative binomial model, degenerates at the zero-abundance point (i.e., its probability mass fully concentrates at zero abundance, leading to an odd situation that no species can occur in the studied sample). Moreover, it is not directly related to the sampling area size. In this sense, the original Fisher's alpha (correspondingly, species richness) is incomparable among ecological communities with varying area sizes. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel area-based logseries model that can account for the compounding effect of the sampling area. The new model can be used to conduct area-based rarefaction and extrapolation of species richness, with the advantage of accurately predicting species richness in a large region that has an area size being hundreds or thousands of times larger than that of a locally observed sample, provided that data follow the proposed model. The power of our proposed model has been validated by extensive numerical simulations and empirically tested through tree species richness extrapolation and interpolation in Brazilian Atlantic forests. Our parametric model is data parsimonious as it is still applicable when only the information on species number, community size, or the numbers of singleton and doubleton species in the local sample is available. Notably, in comparison with the original Fisher's method, our area-based model can provide asymptotically unbiased variance estimation (therefore correct 95% confidence interval) for species richness. In conclusion, the proposed area-based Fisher's logseries model can be of broad applications with clear and proper statistical background. Particularly, it is very suitable for being applied to hyperdiverse ecological assemblages in which nonparametric richness estimators were found to greatly underestimate species richness.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  44,10.1002/ece3.3509     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),area dependency;biodiversity comparison;richness estimation;sampling effect;statistical ecology;NEUTRAL THEORY;LOG-SERIES;DIVERSITY;NUMBER;SAMPLE;SIZE;POPULATION;ESTIMATORS;DEPENDENCE;ABUNDANCE,,

The compositional complexity of an assemblage is not expressible as a single number; standard measures such as diversities (Hill numbers) and entropies (Renyi entropies and Tsallis entropies) vary in their order q which determines the measures' emphasis on rare or common species. Ranking and comparing assemblages depend on the choice of q. Rather than selecting one or a few measures to describe an assemblage, it is preferable to convey the complete story by presenting a continuous profile, a plot of diversity or entropy as a function of q >= 0. This makes it easy to visually compare the compositional complexities of multiple assemblages and to judge the evenness of the relative abundance distributions of the assemblages. In practice, the profile is plotted for all values of q from 0 to q = 3 or 4 (beyond which it generally changes little).        2. These profiles are usually generated by substituting species sample proportions into the complexity measures. However, this empirical approach typically underestimates the true profile for low values of q, because samples usually miss some of the assemblage's species due to under-sampling. Although bias-reduction methods exist for individual measures of order q = 0, 1 and 2, there has been no analytic method that unifies these bias-corrected estimates into a continuous profile.        3. For incomplete sampling data, this work proposes a novel analytic method to obtain accurate, continuous, low-bias diversity and entropy profiles with focus on low orders of q (0 <= q <= 3). Our approach is based on reformulating the diversity and entropy of any order q in terms of the successive discovery rates of new species with respect to sample size, that is the successive slopes of the species accumulation curve. A bootstrap method is applied to obtain approximate variances of our proposed profiles and to construct the associated confidence intervals.        4. Extensive simulations from theoretical models and real surveys show that the proposed profiles greatly reduce under-sampling bias and have substantially lower bias and mean-squared error than the empirical profile, especially for q <= 1. Our method is also extended to deal with incidence data.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  102     Total Times Cited:  110     Cited Reference Count:  38,10.1111/2041-210X.12349     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),diversity;diversity profile;entropy profile;Hill numbers;Renyi entropy;species accumulation curve;species discovery rate;Tsallis entropy;HILL NUMBERS;PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY;PARTITIONING DIVERSITY;ABUNDANCE DISTRIBUTION;RICHNESS;EXTRAPOLATION;RAREFACTION;POPULATION;SAMPLES;COMPLETENESS;Entropy,,

We compare these models to scenarios using simple random sampling and traditional occupancy models via simulation and data collected on a rare plant species, Tamarix ramosissima, found in China. Our simulations show a marked improvement in confidence interval coverage for the new models combined with cluster sampling compared to simple random sampling and traditional occupancy models, with greatest improvement in the presence of low detection probability and spatial correlation in occupancy. Accounting for the design using the simple cluster random-effects model reduces bias considerably, and full spatial modelling reduces bias further, especially for large n when the spatial covariance parameters can be estimated reliably.

We need to improve our capabilities to assess richness trends using datasets collected in unstandardized procedures with potential collection bias. Two methods are proposed and applied to estimate richness change, which both incorporate models for sampling effects and detection probability: (a) nonlinear species accumulation curves with an error variance model and (b) Pradel capture-recapture models. The methods are used to assess nationwide temporal trends (1945-2018) in the species richness of wild bees in the Netherlands. Previously, a decelerating decline in wild bee species richness was inferred for part of this dataset. Among the species accumulation curves, those with nonconstant changes in species richness are preferred. However, when analyzing data subsets, constant changes became selected for non-Bombus bees (for samples in collections) and bumblebees (for spatial grid cells sampled in three periods). Smaller richness declines are predicted for non-Bombus bees than bumblebees. However, when relative losses are calculated from confidence intervals limits, they overlap and touch zero loss. Capture-recapture analysis applied to species encounter histories infers a constant colonization rate per year and constant local species survival for bumblebees and other bees. This approach predicts a 6% reduction in non-Bombus species richness from 1945 to 2018 and a significant 19% reduction for bumblebees. Statistical modeling to detect species richness time trends should be systematically complemented with model checking and simulations to interpret the results. Data inspection, assessing model selection bias, and comparisons of trends in data subsets were essential model checking strategies in this analysis.

Understanding landscape resistance to dispersal is important in connectivity studies and reserve design, but most existing methods use resistance functions with cost parameters that are subjectively chosen by the investigator. We develop an analytic approach allowing for direct estimation of resistance parameters that folds least cost path methods typically used in simulation approaches into a formal statistical model of dispersal distributions. The core of our model is a frequency distribution of dispersal distances expressed as least cost distance rather than Euclidean distance, and which includes terms for feature-specific costs to dispersal and sex (or other traits) of the disperser. The model requires only origin and settlement locations for multiple individuals, such as might be obtained from mark-recapture studies or parentage analyses, and maps of the relevant habitat features. To evaluate whether the model can estimate parameters correctly, we fit our model to data from simulated dispersers in three kinds of landscapes (in which resistance of environmental variables was categorical, continuous with a patchy configuration, or continuous in a trend pattern). We found maximum likelihood estimators of resistance and individual trait parameters to be approximately unbiased with moderate sample sizes. We applied the model to a small grizzly bear dataset to demonstrate how this approach could be used when the primary interest is in the prediction of costs and found that estimates were consistent with expectations based on bear ecology. Our method has important practical applications for testing hypotheses about dispersal ecology and can be used to inform connectivity planning efforts, via the resistance estimates and confidence intervals, which can be used to create a data-driven resistance surface.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  55     Total Times Cited:  60     Cited Reference Count:  73,10.1007/s10980-014-0056-5     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Animal movement;Connectivity;Cost distance;Corridor;Dispersal;Least cost path;Movement;Landscape permeability;SEED DISPERSAL;GENE FLOW;FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY;COMPLEX LANDSCAPES;RESOURCE SELECTION;MODELS;DIFFUSION;ECOLOGY;DYNAMICS;WIND,,

Current approaches involve buffering survey locations with polygons of various sizes and using model selection to identify the best scale. The buffering approach does not acknowledge that the influence of surrounding landscape features should diminish with distance, and it does not yield an estimate of the unknown scale parameters.        The purpose of this paper is to present an approach that allows for statistical inference about the scales at which landscape variables affect abundance.        Our method uses smoothing kernels to average landscape variables around focal sites and uses maximum likelihood to estimate the scale parameters of the kernels and the effects of the smoothed variables on abundance. We assessed model performance using a simulation study and an avian point count dataset.        The simulation study demonstrated that estimators are unbiased and produce correct confidence interval coverage except in the rare case in which there is little spatial autocorrelation in the landscape variable. Canada warbler abundance was more highly correlated with site-level measures of NDVI than landscape-level NDVI, but the reverse was true for elevation. Canada warbler abundance was highest when elevation in the surrounding landscape, defined by an estimated Gaussian kernel, was between 1300 and 1400 m.

For motile species, this 'upscaling' is governed by how well any given movement strategy maximizes encounters with positive factors and minimizes encounters with negative factors. Despite the importance of encounter events for a broad range of ecological processes, encounter theory has not kept pace with developments in animal tracking or movement modelling. Furthermore, existing work has focused primarily on the relationship between animal movement and encounter rates while the relationship between individual movement and the spatial locations of encounter events in the environment has remained conspicuously understudied.        Here, we bridge this gap by introducing a method for describing the long-term encounter location probabilities for movement within home ranges, termed the conditional distribution of encounters (CDE). We then derive this distribution, as well as confidence intervals, implement its statistical estimator into open-source software and demonstrate the broad ecological relevance of this distribution.        We first use simulated data to show how our estimator provides asymptotically consistent estimates. We then demonstrate the general utility of this method for three simulation-based scenarios that occur routinely in biological systems: (a) a population of individuals with home ranges that overlap with neighbours; (b) a pair of individuals with a hard territorial border between their home ranges; and (c) a predator with a large home range that encompassed the home ranges of multiple prey individuals. Using GPS data from white-faced capuchins Cebus capucinus, tracked on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and sleepy lizards Tiliqua rugosa, tracked in Bundey, South Australia, we then show how the CDE can be used to estimate the locations of territorial borders, identify key resources, quantify the potential for competitive or predatory interactions and/or identify any changes in behaviour that directly result from location-specific encounter probability.        The CDE enables researchers to better understand the dynamics of populations of interacting individuals. Notably, the general estimation framework developed in this work builds straightforwardly off of home range estimation and requires no specialized data collection protocols.

In this manuscript, we develop a new spatial capture-recapture model that estimates both call rate and animal density from the acoustic survey alone, without requiring an independently estimated call rate. Our approach therefore alleviates the need for the additional fieldwork of physically locating and monitoring individual animals. We illustrate our method and compare it to an existing approach using a simulation study and an application to data collected on an acoustic survey of the visually cryptic Cape peninsula moss frog Arthroleptella lightfooti.

Routine censuses of the two populations of critically endangered mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei have been conducted over the last decades to monitor populations and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation strategies. A census in 2006 of the mountain gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, showed the value of genetic analysis of fecal samples collected at nest sites by revealing discrepancies between the numbers of nests and uniquely identified gorillas. In this study, we censused the Bwindi gorilla population using a 'mark-recapture' method which involved genetic analysis of fecal samples collected in 2011 during two 'sweep' surveys of the entire park. We found that a notable proportion of gorillas were missed in either of the two sweeps (minimum 35% and 31%, respectively). Based on the number of genotyped gorillas and correction factors, we estimated the population to contain a minimum of 400 individuals. Using the mark-recapture approach, we infer possibly as many as 430 gorillas (95% confidence interval: 398-487). As the 2010 census of the Virunga Massif population found 480 gorillas, the total number of mountain gorillas worldwide is at least 880 individuals. Simulations using different mark-recapture models suggest that a future census of Bwindi mountain gorillas would benefit by increasing the number of sweeps in order to achieve accurate and precise results. Finally, based on our results, we recommend a sequential approach incorporating a pilot study and simulations for optimizing time and resources in large mammal genetic census studies.

A maximum-likelihood procedure is introduced here that uses pre- and post-dispersal population samples of biparentally inherited genetic markers to jointly estimate contemporary seed and pollen immigration rates from a set of discrete external sources into a target population. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that accurate estimates and reliable confidence intervals can be obtained using this method for both pollen and seed migration rates at modest sample sizes (100 parents/population and 100 offspring) when population differentiation is moderate (FST = 0.1), or by increasing pre-dispersal samples (to about 500 parents/population) when genetic divergence is weak (FST = 0.01). The method exhibited low sensitivity to the number of source populations and achieved good accuracy at affordable genetic resolution (10 loci with 10 equifrequent alleles each). Unsampled source populations introduced positive biases in migration rate estimates from sampled sources, although they were minor when the proportion of immigration from the latter was comparatively low. A practical application of the method to a metapopulation of the Australian resprouter shrub Banksia attenuata revealed comparable levels of directional seed and pollen migration among dune groups, and the estimate of seed dispersal was higher than a previous estimate based on conservative assignment tests. The method should be of interest to researchers and managers assessing broad-scale nonequilibrium seed and pollen gene flow dynamics in plants.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  35,10.1111/j.1755-0998.2011.03092.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),gene flow;introgression;long-distance dispersal;maximum likelihood;pollination;recent migration;LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL;RECENT MIGRATION RATES;GENE FLOW;MULTILOCUS GENOTYPES;PATERNITY ANALYSIS;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;ASSIGNMENT METHODS;BAYESIAN METHOD;SCOTS PINE;DIFFERENTIATION;Pollen,,

A computer simulation model is required in order to better understand these vegetation dynamics and to develop best management practices, as the focus of the comprehensive Everglades restoration plan (CERP) shifts more toward ecology. Recently, the coupled regional simulation model (RSM) and transport and reaction simulation engine (TARSE) model were adapted to simulate ecological processes, specifically Typha domingensis (cattail) dynamics in the Everglades, with five levels of increasing complexity being used. These levels ranged from a simple logistic equation to additional functionality through influences from water depth, soil phosphorus concentration and interspecies competition. In order to address the model ""relevance trilemma"" - balancing complexity, uncertainty and sensitivity, a global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis (GUSA) was conducted on these five levels of algorithm complexity. Spatial uncertainty in the initial data maps was addressed through the use of a sequential indicator simulation (SIS), whereby 250 alternate maps, all obeying observed data and spatial correlation, were produced. Other parameters used in the GUSA include the sawgrass initial density (uniformly distributed across Water Conservation Area 2A), the growth rate for both cattail and sawgrass, a water depth value, and soil phosphorus concentration. The statistic used for the GUSA output was the change in regional mean density (DM) from initial conditions, which signals an increase or decrease in mean density over time. The global uncertainty was determined through a 95% confidence interval on a frequency distribution plot of the DM statistic. Complexity Levels 1 and 4 had the lowest uncertainties. The narrow output distribution of Level 1 (the simple logistic equation) was expected and does not inspire confidence in that algorithm being able to accurately represent the dynamics of the system. The variance-based Sobol method was used to conduct the global sensitivity analysis. Through this analysis it was determined that the most influential parameter was water depth, followed by soil phosphorus concentration and initial distribution. The first order and total order sensitivities were very similar for complexity Levels 3, 4, and 5. This is expected because, aside from Level 5, there are no feed-back or interaction effects in the algorithms. Levels 1 and 2 have different sensitivities due to the low number of variables associated with each algorithm. Therefore it was determined that the Level 4 complexity algorithm was the most relevant, or best suited, to model cattail densities in the region, as it contains the least uncertainty, without increasing sensitivity, and it has less risk of over-parameterisation as is potentially the case with Level 5.

Temporal fluctuations in vital rates such as survival, growth or reproduction alter long-term population dynamics and can change the dynamics from invasion and population persistence to extinction. Projections of population dynamics made in the absence of such fluctuations may consequently be misleading. However, data for estimation of yearly fluctuations in demographic parameters are often limited. Accordingly, the current diverse range of statistical and demographic modelling strategies used for stochastic population modelling may influence predictions.        2. We used simulations to explore the effects of different methods of parameter estimation on projections of population dynamics obtained using stochastic integral projection models (IPMs). The simulations were built from data on a monocarpic thistle, Carlina vulgaris, and an ungulate, Soay sheep, Ovis aries; these populations are subject to yearly fluctuation in vital rates facilitating the exploration of the effects of different methods of model construction on the properties of stochastic IPMs. Specifically, we looked at effects on the stochastic growth rate, log lambda(s), and themean and variance in the one-step population growth rate (Nt+1/N-t).        3. Our analyses showed that none of the tested approaches resulted in large biases in the estimation of log lambda(s). However, when realistic study durations (e.g. 12 years) were used for statistical modelling, the confidence intervals around the lambda(s) estimates remained large. Estimation of the variance in one-step population growth rates, on the other hand, was strongly sensitive to the method employed, and the overestimation and underestimation of the variance were also influenced by the life history of the organism.        4. Our findings highlight the need to consider the influences of statistical and demographic modelling approaches when population dynamics have significant temporal stochasticity, as in population viability analyses and evolutionary predictions of bet hedging.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  24     Total Times Cited:  24     Cited Reference Count:  41,10.1111/2041-210X.12405     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"covariation;integral projection model;population growth rate;population projection;population viability;random vs. fixed effects;sampling effects;stochastic simulations;VARIABLE ENVIRONMENTS;PLANT-POPULATIONS;MATRIX MODELS;SOAY SHEEP;SIZE;AGE;DEMOGRAPHY;EVOLUTION;DECISIONS;SELECTION;Models, Statistical",,

Different scales of temporal changes in fruits, for example within-versus across-year variability, are driven by different processes, but are not always easy to disentangle. We apply generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to study a long-term fruit presence-absence data set of individual trees collected from a high-altitude Afromontane tropical rain forest site within Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), Uganda. Our primary aim was to highlight and evaluate GAMM methodology, and quantify both intra-and interannual changes in fruit production. First, we conduct several simulation experiments to study the practical utility of model selection and smooth term estimation relevant for disentangling intra-and interannual variability. These simulations indicate that estimation of nonlinearity and seasonality is generally accurately identified using asymptotic theory. Applied to the empirical data set, we found that the forest-level fruiting variability arises from both regular seasonality and significant interannual variability, with the years 2009-2010 in particular showing a significant increase in the presence of fruits-driven by increased productivity of most species, and a regular annual peak associated occurring at the end of one of the two dry seasons. Our analyses illustrate a statistical framework for disentangling short-term increases/decreases in fruiting effort while pinpointing specific times in which fruiting is atypical, providing a first step for assessing the impacts of regular and irregular (e.g., climate change) abiotic covariates on fruiting phenology. Some consequences of the rich diversity of fruiting patterns observed here for the population biology of frugivores in BINP are also discussed.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  24     Cited Reference Count:  50,10.1002/ece3.707     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bwindi Impenetrable National Park;climate change;nonparametric models;phenology;plant reproductive ecology;tropical forest ecology;BAYESIAN CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS;TROPICAL FORESTS;MARKOV-MODELS;NATIONAL-PARK;EVOLUTION;CONSEQUENCES;SELECTION;PATTERNS;ECOLOGY;PACKAGE;Fruit;Seasons,,

Volunteer-based citizen science' schemes now play a valuable role in deriving biodiversity indicators, both aiding the development of conservation policies and measuring the success of management. We provide a new method for analysing such data based on counts of invertebrate species characterised by highly variable numbers within a season combined with a substantial proportion of proposed survey visits not made.        2. Using the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) for illustration, we propose a two-stage model that makes more efficient use of the data than previous analyses, whilst accounting for missing values. Firstly, generalised additive models were applied separately to data from each year to estimate the annual seasonal flight patterns. The estimated daily values were then normalised to estimate a seasonal pattern that is the same across sites but differs between years. A model was then fitted to the full set of annual counts, with seasonal values as an offset, to estimate annual changes in abundance accounting for the varying seasonality.        3. The method was tested and compared against the current approach and a simple linear interpolation using simulated data, parameterised with values estimated from UKBMS data for three example species. The simulation study demonstrated accurate estimation of linear time trends and improved power for detecting trends compared with the current model.        4. Comparison of indices for species covered by the UKBMS under the various model approaches showed similar predicted trends over time, but confidence intervals were generally narrower for the two-stage model. In addition to creating more robust trend estimates, the new method allows all volunteer records to contribute to the indices and thus incorporates data from more populations within the geographical range of a species. On average, the current model only enables data from 60% of 10km(2) grid squares with monitored sites to be included, whereas the two-stage model uses all available data and hence provides full coverage at least of the monitored area. As many invertebrate species exhibit similar patterns of emergence or voltinism, our two-stage method could be applied to other taxa.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  35     Total Times Cited:  35     Cited Reference Count:  46,10.1111/2041-210X.12053     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),butterfly monitoring;citizen science;count data;generalised additive models;missing data;POPULATION TRENDS;CITIZEN SCIENCE;CONSERVATION;DIVERSITY;DECLINES;SCHEMES;MODELS;COMMON;Seasons,,

Capture-mark-reencounter (CMR) methods using marked animals are a standard approach, particularly in recent history with the development of innovative methods of marking using camera traps or DNA samples. However, estimates of abundance from multiple encounters of marked individuals are biased low when individual heterogeneity of encounter probabilities is not accounted for in the estimator. We evaluated the operating characteristics of the Huggins logit-normal estimator through computer simulations, using Gaussian-Hermite quadrature to model individual encounter heterogeneity. We simulated individual encounter data following a factorial design with 2 levels of sampling occasions (t=5, 10), 3 levels of abundance (N=100, 500, 1,000), 4 levels of median detection probabilities (p=0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) for each sampling occasion (on the probability scale), and 4 levels of individual heterogeneity (sigma(p)=0, 0.5, 1, 2; on the logit normal scale), resulting in a design space consisting of 96 simulation scenarios (2x3x4x4). For each scenario, we performed 1,000 simulations using the Huggins estimators M-t, M-0, M-tRE, and M-0RE, where the RE subscript corresponds to the random effects model. As expected, the M-t and M-0 estimators were biased when individual heterogeneity was present but unbiased for sigma(p)=0 data. The estimators for M-tRE and M-0RE were biased high for N=100 and median p0.2 but showed little bias elsewhere. The bias is attributed to the occasional sets of data that result in a low overall detection probability and a resulting highly skewed sampling distribution of This result is confirmed in that the median of the sampling distributions was only slightly biased high. The random effects estimators performed poorly for sigma(p)=0 data, mainly because a log link function forces the estimate of sigma(p)>0. However, the Fletcher statistic provided useful evidence to evaluate sigma(p)>0, as did likelihood ratio tests of the null hypothesis sigma(p)=0. Generally, confidence interval coverage of N appears close to the nominal 95% expected when the estimator is not biased. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society.

Rao's spacing test is often used to evaluate the support the data offers for the null hypothesis of uniformity. Here we demonstrate that the traditional version of this test fails to adequately control type I error rate when the data is non-continuous (i.e. is rounded/grouped to a finite number of discrete values, e.g. to the nearest degree, a common situation). To overcome this issue, we provide a numerically-intensive simulation version of the test.        Methods: We use a simulation study to explore the performance of the traditional and our novel variant on Rao's spacing test, both in terms of control of type I error rate and statistical power.        Results: When data is measured on a continuous circular scale then both methods offer good control of type I error and similar statistical power. If the data is rounded (even to a relatively fine scale such as to the nearest degree - giving 360 possible values), however, the traditional method produces highly inflated type I error rates, particularly with high sample sizes, that make it inappropriate for application to such data. In contrast, our simulation method retains good control of type I error while offering levels of statistical power similar to the traditional Rao test.        Conclusions: The traditional method of applying Rao's spacing test should be replaced by the simulation-based variant introduced here. The two methods offer similar performance but only the simulation method retains good control of the type I error rate when circular data is rounded to a finite set of values (likely due to limited precision of measuring equipment). Adoption of the simulation variant will substantially improve the reliability of this regularly-used test in the commonplace situation where data values are rounded.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  13,10.1186/s40462-019-0160-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Circular statistics;Limited precision;Rayleigh test;Testing for circular uniformity;Randomisation testing;Statistical power;Oriana,,

Other approaches include model-based methods and weighted correlations of different metrics of trait-environment associations, the best known of which is the fourth-corner correlation method. We investigated these three general statistical approaches for trait-environment associations: CWMr, five weighted correlation metrics (Peres-Neto, Dray, & ter Braak, Ecography, 40, 806-816, 2017), and two multilevel models (MLM) using four different methods for computing p-values. We first compared the methods applied to a plant community dataset. To determine the validity of the statistical conclusions, we then performed a simulation study. CWMr gave highly significant associations for both traits, whereas the other methods gave a mix of support. CWMr had inflated type I errors for some simulation scenarios, implying that the significant results for the data could be spurious. The weighted correlation methods had generally good type I error control but had low power. One of the multilevel models, that from Jamil, Ozinga, Kleyer, and ter Braak (Journal of Vegetation Science, 24, 988-1000, 2013) had both good type I error control and high power when an appropriate method was used to obtain p-values. In particular, if there was no correlation among species in their abundances among sites, a parametric bootstrap likelihood ratio test (LRT) gave the best power. When there was correlation among species in their abundances, a conditional parametric LRT had correct type I errors but had lower power. There is no overall best method for identifying trait-environment associations. For the simple task of testing associations between single environmental variables and single traits, the weighted correlations with permutation tests all had good type I error control, and their ease of implementation is an advantage. For the more complex task of multivariate analyses and model fitting, and when high statistical power is needed, we recommend MLM2 (Jamil et al., 2013). However, care must be taken to ensure against inflated type I errors for both weighted correlations and MLM2.

The specification of the SWM is a crucial step, but the SWM is generally chosen arbitrarily, regardless of the sampling design characteristics. Here, we compare the statistical performances of different types of SWMs (distance-based or graph-based) in contrasted realistic simulation scenarios. Then, we present an optimization method and evaluate its performances compared to the arbitrary choice of the most-widely used distance-based SWM. Results showed that the distance-based SWMs generally had lower power and accuracy than other specifications, and strongly underestimated spatial signals. The optimization method, using a correction procedure for multiple tests, had a correct type I error rate, and had higher power and accuracy than an arbitrary choice of the SWM. Nevertheless, the power decreased when too many SWMs were compared, resulting in a trade-off between the gain of accuracy and the loss of power. We advocate that future studies should optimize the choice of the SWM using a small set of appropriate candidates.

The quest for 'assembly rules', that is the processes shaping the species composition of communities, is a central issue in community ecology. Nevertheless, so far there is no general agreement on a framework to detect assembly rules in real-life data: several key elements are still missing or heavily disputed, including the choice of the appropriate test statistic (e.g. functional diversity index) and randomization strategy for each major assembly process.        2. Simulation studies based on artificial communities can help to explore the usefulness of different approaches in detecting assembly rules. Nevertheless, the currently dominant approach to simulate artificial communities (i.e. selecting species from a pool based solely on trait values) oversimplifies the complex processes involved in community assembly and thus fails to produce realistic patterns. Consequently, its value for testing methodologies is seriously limited.        3. In this study, we implemented a flexible, individual-based algorithm simulating real-life community processes (individuals are born, survive, compete for resources, reproduce and die), to generate artificial species composition data. With the help of this algorithm, we estimated the type I error rates and the statistical power of five different diversity indices (FRic, Rao's quadratic entropy, FEve, the variance of functional distances, and the variance of nearest-neighbour distances) in combination with three randomization strategies (randomization of trait values in the whole data set, within-plots and within the range of trait values occurring in each plot) for detecting two underlying assembly processes (habitat filtering and limiting similarity). We also tested the influence of all adjustable simulation parameters on the simulation results in a sensitivity analysis framework.        4. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the individual-based simulation framework proposed here can be used for creating artificial community data with realistic pattern of trait values. Based on the results, Rao's quadratic entropy performed best for detecting both habitat filtering (trait convergence) and limiting similarity (trait divergence). Functional richness may also be suitable for detect traiting convergence. Functional evenness and variance of nearest-neighbour distances, however, should not be used for finding assembly rules.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  60     Total Times Cited:  63     Cited Reference Count:  61,10.1111/2041-210X.12450     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),assembly rules;functional evenness;functional richness;Rao's quadratic entropy;statistical power;type I error rate;PHYLOGENETIC COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;LIMITING SIMILARITY;ASSEMBLY PROCESSES;COMPETITIVE-EXCLUSION;STOCHASTIC-PROCESSES;SPECIES COEXISTENCE;BIOTIC INTERACTIONS;FISH COMMUNITIES;MULTIPLE TRAITS;PATTERNS,,

However, recent papers raised concerns about the power of the Mantel test itself. Hence the question: Is the Mantel correlogram powerful enough to be useful? To explore this issue, we compared the performances of the Mantel correlogram to those of other methods, using numerical simulations based on random, normally distributed data. For a single response variable, we compared it to the Moran and Geary correlograms. Type I error rates of the three methods were correct. Power of the Mantel correlogram was nearly as high as that of the univariate methods. For the multivariate case, the test of the multivariate variogram developed in the context of multiscale ordination is in fact a Mantel test, so that the power of the two methods is the same by definition. We devised an alternative permutation test based on the variance, which yielded similar results. Overall, the power of the Mantel test was high, the method successfully detecting spatial correlation at rates similar to the permutation test of the variance statistic in multivariate variograms.

This situation invites the development of new methods capable of using all observation levels. To this end, new multilevel and weighted averaging-based regression methods are proposed. Compared to existing methods, the new multilevel method, called MLM3, has additional site-related random effects; they represent the unknowns in the environment that interact with the trait. The new weighted averaging method combines site-level CWMr with a species-level regression of Species Niche Centroids on to the trait. Because species can vary enormously in frequency and abundance giving diversity variation among sites, the regressions are weighted by Hill's effective number (N-2) of occurrences of each species and the N-2-diversity of a site, and are subsequently combined in a sequential test procedure known as the max test. Using the test statistics of these new methods, the permutation-based max test provides strong statistical evidence for trait-environment association in a plant community dataset, where existing methods show weak evidence. In simulations, the existing multilevel model showed bias and type I error inflation, whereas MLM3 did not. Out of the weighted averaging-based regression methods, the N-2-weighted version best controlled the type I error rate. MLM3 was superior to the weighted averaging-based methods with up to 30% more power.

However, while these pure fractions can be tested using a classical residuals permutation procedure, no specific method has been developed to test the shared space-environment fraction (SSEF). Yet, the SSEF is expected to encompass a major driver of community assembly, that is, an induced spatial dependence effect (ISD; i.e. the reflection of a spatially structured habitat filter on a species distribution). A reliable test of this fraction is therefore crucial to properly test the presence of an ISD on ecological data. To bridge the gap, we propose to test the SSEF through spatially-constrained null models: torus-translations, and Moran spectral randomisations. We investigated the type I error rate and statistical power of our method based on two real environmental datasets and simulations of tree distributions. Ten types of tree distribution displaying contrasted aggregation properties were simulated, and their abundances were sampled in 153 regularly-distributed 20 x 20 m quadrats. The SSEF was tested for 1000 simulated tree distributions either unrelated to the environment, or filtered by environmental variables displaying contrasting spatial structures. The method proposed provided a correct type I error rate (< 0.05). The statistical power was high (> 0.9) when abundances were filtered by an environmental variable structured at broad scale. However, the spatial resolution allowed by the sampling design limited the power of the method when using a fine-scale filtering variable. This highlighted that an ISD can be properly detected providing that the spatial pattern of the filtering process is correctly captured by the sampling design of the study.

Since there is no common unit of observation, the significance of the relationships is tested using a double permutation procedure (site based and species based). This method implies that all species and sites are independent of each other. However, this fundamental hypothesis might be flawed because of phylogenetic relatedness between species and spatial autocorrelation in the environmental data. Here, using a simulation-based experiment, we demonstrate how the presence of spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelations can, in some circumstances, lead to inflated type I error rates, suggesting that significant associations can be misidentified. As an alternative, we propose a new randomization approach designed to avoid this issue, based on Moran's spectral randomization. In this approach, standard permutations are replaced by constrained randomizations so that the distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis is built with additional constraints to preserve the phylogenetic and spatial structures of the observed data.

Results from a pilot study may be extrapolated by simulation to predict the effectiveness of different configurations of multiple detectors, but simulation is slow and requires technical expertise. Another approach for evaluating novel designs is to compute intermediate variables such as the expected number of detected individuals E(n) and expected number of recapture events E(r), and to seek relationships between these variables and quantities of interest such as precision and power. We present formulae for the expected counts and power.

Recently, these data have been applied to increasingly elaborate science and policy questions, using a range of methods. At present, we lack a firm understanding of which methods, if any, are capable of delivering unbiased trend estimates on policy-relevant time-scales. We identified a set of candidate methods that employ data filtering criteria and/or correction factors to deal with variation in recorder activity. We designed a computer simulation to compare the statistical properties of these methods under a suite of realistic data collection scenarios. We measured the Type I error rates of each method-scenario combination, as well as the power to detect genuine trends. We found that simple methods produce biased trend estimates, and/or had low power. Most methods are robust to variation in sampling effort, but biases in spatial coverage, sampling effort per visit, and detectability, as well as turnover in community composition, all induced some methods to fail. No method was wholly unaffected by all forms of variation in recorder activity, although some performed well enough to be useful. We warn against the use of simple methods. Sophisticated methods that model the data collection process offer the greatest potential to estimate timely trends, notably Frescalo and occupancy-detection models.

To ensure current methods are appropriate for monitoring long-term trends in forest composition, structure and function, we performed a power analysis of key forest metrics using data collected in each park and covering two four-year survey cycles. We determined statistical power by repeatedly generating bootstrapped datasets with specified percent change between survey cycles in the value of each metric, and then testing whether a mixed effects model detected a significant change. We applied effect sizes ranging from a 50% decline to a 50% increase in 5% increments. Power analyses indicated that, for most key forest metrics, our monitoring program met the target of detecting a 40% change in a metric over a 12-year period with 80% power and a Type I error rate of 0.10. Power also tended to improve with subsequent repeated surveys. Native species richness and live-tree basal area metrics consistently performed well for all parks. Average percent cover of plant groups performed better than quadrat frequency. Regeneration metrics performed best in parks with low or high regeneration rates. Coarse woody debris volume, snag abundance, and invasive species richness did not meet the trend detection target in multiple parks. In most cases, metrics that failed to meet the trend detection target in one or several parks had high proportions of zeros and relatively low overall values for the respective park.

However, the CWM approach does not yield valid tests, as random traits (or random indicator values) are far too often judged significantly related to the environmental variable, even when the trait and environmental variable are extrinsic to (not derived from) the community data. Existing solutions are the ZS-modified test (Zeleny & Schaffers,) and the max (or sequential) test based on the fourth-corner correlation. Both tests are based on permutations which become cumbersome when many tests need to be carried out and many permutations are required, as in methods that correct for multiple testing. The main goal of this study was to compare these existing permutation-based solutions and to develop a quick and easy parametric test that can replace them.        MethodsResultsThis study decomposes the fourth-corner correlation in two ways, which suggests a simple parametric approach consisting of assessing the significances of two linear regressions, one plot-level test as in the CWM approach and one species-level test, the reverse of the CWM approach, that regresses the environmental mean per species (i.e. the species niche centroid) on to the trait. The tests are combined by taking the maximum p-value. The type I error rates and power of this parametric max test are examined by simulation of one- and two-dimensional Gaussian models and log-linear models.        The ZS-modified test and the fourth-corner max test are conservative in different scenarios, the ZS-modified test being even more conservative than the fourth-corner. The new parametric max test is shown to control the type I error and has equal or even higher power than permutation tests based on the fourth-corner, the ZS-modified test and variants thereof.

The tempo of evolutionary change through time is among the most heavily studied dimensions of macroevolution using phylogenies.        2. Here, we present a simple, likelihood-based method for comparing the rate of phenotypic evolution for continuous characters between trees. Our method is derived from a previous approach published by Brian O'Meara and colleagues in 2006.        3. We examine the statistical performance of the method and find that it suffers from the typical downward bias expected for maximum likelihood estimates of the variance, but only for very small trees. We find that evolutionary rates are estimated with minimal bias for trees of even relatively modest size.        4. We also find that type I error rates based on a likelihood-ratio test are minimally elevated above the nominal level, even for small phylogenies. The type I error rate can be reduced to a level at or below its nominal value by substituting a test-statistic distribution obtained via simulation under the null hypothesis of no difference in evolutionary rate among trees.        5. We discuss the consequences of failing to account for uncertainty in the estimation of species means or in the phylogeny, and describe strategies for taking this uncertainty into consideration during estimation. We also identify how our approach is related to previous methods for comparing the rate of evolution among different clades of a single tree or between different phenotypic traits. Finally, we describe how the method can be applied to different evolutionary models and to discrete characters-options that are already implemented in software.        6.

Group-level parameters may be compared to infer differences among levels. We would conclude a non-zero pairwise difference, separately, for each pair in the group, when the respective 95% credible interval excludes zero. Classical procedures suggest that the rejection procedure should be adjusted to control the family-wise error rate (FWER) for a family of differences. Adjustments for FWER have been considered unnecessary in HB models due to partial pooling whereby increased pooling strength - group-level parameters become more alike - could lead to decreased rejection rates (Type I error, FWER, or Power) and increased false acceptance rates (Type 2 error and its family-wise analogue). To address this, we conducted a simulation experiment with factors of sample size, group size, balance (missingness), overall mean and ratio of within- to between-group variances, resulting in 2016 factor-level combinations ('scenarios'), replicated 100 times, producing 201,600 pseudo datasets analysed in a Bayesian framework. We evaluated the results in the context of a new partial pooling index (PPI), which we show is also applicable to more complex model structures based on four real-data examples. Simulation results confirm intuition that rejection rates (false and true) decrease and false acceptance rates increase with increasing PPI or pooling strength (scenario-level R-2 = 0.81-0.97). The relationship with PPI differed greatly for balanced versus unbalanced designs and was affected by group size, especially for family-wise errors. Critically, an HB model does not guarantee that the FWER will follow a set significance level (alpha); for example, even minor imbalance can lead to FWER > alpha for weak to moderate pooling. These results are confirmed by the real-data examples, suggesting that ecologists need to consider FWER when applying HB models, especially for large group sizes or incomplete datasets. Contrary to current thought, HB models are not immune to issues of multiplicity, and our proposed PPI offers a method for evaluating if a particular HB analysis is likely to produce FWER <= alpha (no adjustment or alternative solution required).",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  36,10.1111/2041-210X.13139     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),borrowing of strength;effective number of parameters;family-wise error;hierarchical model;imbalance;partial pooling;type I error;FUTURE,,

Social network methods have become a key tool for describing, modelling and testing hypotheses about the social structures of animals. However, due to the non-independence of network data and the presence of confounds, specialised statistical techniques are often needed to test hypotheses in these networks. Datastream permutations, originally developed to test the null hypothesis of random social structure, have become a popular tool for testing a wide array of null hypotheses in animal social networks. In particular, they have been used to test whether exogenous factors are related to network structure by interfacing these permutations with regression models.        2. Here, we show that these datastream permutations typically do not represent the null hypothesis of interest to researchers interfacing animal social network analysis with regression modelling, and use simulations to demonstrate the potential pitfalls of using this methodology.        3. Our simulations show that, if used to indicate whether a relationship exists between network structure and a covariate, datastream permutations can result in extremely high type I error rates, in some cases approaching 50%. In the same set of simulations, traditional node-label permutations produced appropriate type I error rates (similar to 5%).        4. Our analysis shows that datastream permutations do not represent the appropriate null hypothesis for these analyses. We suggest that potential alternatives to this procedure may be found in regarding the problems of non-independence of network data and unreliability of observations separately.

Computationally intensive statistical techniques such as simultaneous autoregression (SAR) are used to provide credible inference, yet landscape studies make choices about autocorrelation structure and data reduction techniques without adequate understanding of the consequences for model estimation and inference.        Objectives Our goal is to understand the effects of misspecification of neighborhood size, subsampling, and data partitioning on SAR estimation and inference.        Methods We use remotely sensed burn severity for a large wildfire in north-central Washington State as a case study. First we estimate SAR for remotely sensed burn severity data at multiple subsampling intensities, data partitions, and neighborhood distances. Second, we simulate landscape burn severity data with SAR errors and calculate type I error rates for SAR estimated at the simulation neighborhood distance, and at misspecified neighborhood distances.        Results Subsampling and misspecification of the neighborhood result in spurious inference and modified coefficient estimates. Type I error rates are close to the specified alpha-level when the model is estimated at both the simulation neighborhood and the distance that minimizes AIC.        Conclusions By evaluating the effectiveness of pre-burn fuel reduction treatments on subsequent wildfire burn severity, we demonstrate that misspecification of the neighborhood distance and subsampling the data compromises inference and estimation. Using AIC to choose the neighborhood distance provides type I error rates near the stated alpha-level in simulated data.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  19,10.1007/s10980-017-0499-6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Simultaneous autoregression;Spatially explicit data;Fuel treatments;SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION;GEOGRAPHICAL ECOLOGY;RED HERRINGS;WILDLAND FIRES;BURN SEVERITY;PATTERNS,,

This poses serious limitations for comparative biologists, who must either simplify how they quantify phenotypic traits, or alter the biological hypotheses they wish to examine. In this article, I propose a new statistical procedure for performing ANOVA and regressionmodels in a phylogenetic context that can accommodate high-dimensional datasets. The approach is derived from the statistical equivalency between parametric methods using covariance matrices and methods based on distance matrices. Using simulations under Brownian motion, I show that the method displays appropriate Type I error rates and statistical power, whereas standard parametric procedures have decreasing power as data dimensionality increases. As such, the new procedure provides a useful means of assessing trait covariation across a set of taxa related by a phylogeny, enabling macroevolutionary biologists to test hypotheses of adaptation, and phenotypic change in high-dimensional datasets.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  153     Total Times Cited:  154     Cited Reference Count:  92,10.1111/evo.12463     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geometric morphometrics;macroevolution;morphological evolution;phylogenetic comparative method;NORTH-AMERICAN SALAMANDERS;MORPHOLOGICAL DIVERSIFICATION;SPECIES INTERACTIONS;HABITAT USE;BODY SHAPE;EVOLUTION;SIZE;ALLOMETRY;PLETHODON;INTEGRATION,,

However, they are necessarily abstractions of natural systems, making predictive validation imperative. Models, which make predictions about binary outcomes (e.g. Species distribution models, population viability analysis, disease/invasion models), are widespread in the ecological literature. When supporting probability-based management decisions, these predictions need to be assessed with respect to the degree to which predicted probabilities agree with future outcomes. Many predictive models are not validated using external data and are often only assessed in terms of their ability to discriminate between outcomes rather than the degree to which they predicted the correct probabilities. We develop a novel Validation Metric Applied to Probabilistic Predictions (VMAPP), which provides a goodness-of-fit test of calibration for probabilistic prediction models using binary data (e.g. presences and absences in models of species distributions). We analyse the theoretic properties of this test and compare its performance against existing methods, and apply it to a published model in invasion biology, which forecasts the establishment probability of the zooplanktivorous spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus). We selected 102 additional sites to sample four years after the training data were collected and use this independently collected data to assess predictive reliability using VMAPP. Theoretic simulation analysis shows that VMAPP outperforms existing metrics (Cox's regression technique and Hosmer & Lemeshow's (2) test) in terms of statistical power to identify model miscalibration. Further, we find that under realistic conditions where model parameters are estimated (and have associated uncertainty) that VMAPP is more robust, retaining the appropriate type-I error rates (5%) where previous metrics fail (17%). Application of VMAPP to a published invasion model using empirical validation data shows that in addition to having high discriminative power, the model's probabilistic predictions agree with the observed outcomes as measured by VMAPP. We argue that quantifying ecological predictions as probabilities with associated uncertainty provides the most useful information to support management decisions. Ecological predictions, while uncertain, should still be rigorously validated. Identifying the circumstances in which our predictions deviate from observation can further inform the next generation of the model, bringing prediction and reality ever closer. <doi origin=""wiley"" registered=""yes"">10.1111/(ISSN)2041-210X</doi",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  49,10.1111/2041-210X.12238     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),AUC;binary outcomes;forecasting;prediction;probability;validation;SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS;PRESENCE-ABSENCE MODELS;PRESENCE-ONLY DATA;LOGISTIC-REGRESSION;BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS;PROPAGULE PRESSURE;HABITAT MODELS;CLIMATE-CHANGE;RISK ANALYSIS;INLAND LAKES;Calibration,,

We investigated the statistical performance of SPELT in relation to degree of lag, sample size (species pairs), and strength of association between traits. We simulated trait evolution under two models: one in which trait X changes during speciation and the lagging trait Y catches up as a function of time since speciation; and another in which trait X evolves in a random walk and the lagging trait Y is a function of X at a previous time period. Type I error rates under no lag were close to the expected level of 5%, indicating that the method is not prone to false-positives.

Likelihood methods have been developed to detect such diversity dependence. However, a thorough test of whether such approaches correctly infer diversity dependence is lacking. Here, we simulate phylogenetic branching under linear negative diversity-dependent and diversity-independent models and estimate from the simulated phylogenies the maximum-likelihood parameters for three different conditionings - on survival of the birth-death process given the crown age, on tree size (N) and on tree size given the crown age. We report the accuracy of recovering the simulation parameters and the reliability of the model selection based on the (2) likelihood ratio test. Parameter estimate accuracy: Conditioning on survival given the crown age yields a severe bias of the carrying capacity K towards N and an upward bias of the speciation rate, particularly in clades where diversity-dependent feedbacks are still weak (N << K). Conditioning on N yields an overestimate of K and an underestimate of speciation rate, particularly when saturation has been reached. Dual conditioning yields relatively unbiased parameter estimates on average, but the deviation from the true value for any single estimate may be large. Model selection reliability: The frequency of incorrectly rejecting a diversity-independent model when the simulation was diversity-independent (type I error) differs substantially from the significance level used in the likelihood ratio test, rendering the likelihood ratio test inappropriate. The frequency of correctly rejecting the diversity-independent model when the simulation was diversity-dependent (power) is larger when the clade is closer to equilibrium and for conditioning on crown age. We conclude that conditioning on crown age has the best statistical properties overall, but caution that parameter estimates may be biased. To assess parameter uncertainty in future studies of diversity dependence on real data, we recommend parametric bootstrapping, examination of the likelihood surface and comparison of estimates across the types of conditioning. To assess model selection reliability, we discourage the use of the (2) likelihood ratio test or AIC (which are equivalent in this case), but recommend a likelihood ratio test based on parametric bootstrap.

This study presents simple simulations of fossil records in which origination and extinction probabilities for each lineage are held constant. Nonetheless, the total number of turnover events per time bin varies stochastically, producing statistical ""noise."" Various simulation and analytical assumptions are examined to determine their impact on the type I error rate (i.e., how often ""pulses"" are detected in a purely stochastic process).

GPS units, which form the primary source of location data, have become cheaper, more accurate, lighter and less power-hungry, and their accuracy has been further improved with the addition of inertial measurement units. The consequence is a glut of geospatial time series data, recorded at rates that range from one position fix every several hours (to maximize system lifetime) to ten fixes per second (in high dynamic situations). Since data of this quality and volume have only recently become available, the analytical methods to extract behavioral information from raw position data are at an early stage of development. An instance of this lies in the analysis of animal movement patterns. When investigating solitary animals, the timing and location of instances of avoidance and association are important behavioral markers. In this paper, a novel analytical method to detect avoidance and association between individuals is proposed; unlike existing methods, assumptions about the shape of the territories or the nature of individual movement are not needed. Simulations demonstrate that false positives (type I error) are rare (1%-3%), which means that the test rarely suggests that there is an association if there is none.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  28,10.1002/ece3.4805     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),African wild dogs;analysis;association;avoidance theory;ecology;GPS;leopards;permutations;statistics;BEHAVIOR;DOGS,,

An 8-division variant was developed for benthic systems in the 1990s; the capacity to speed collection of seagrass coverage data led to its adoption by several large-scale monitoring programs in the USA. However, debate regarding how best to treat ordinal BB data in statistical analysis has stymied progress in the comparison of status and trends. Methods specific to ordinal data exist; however, they have generally been ignored in favor of transformation to percent cover or the use of BB categories as continuous data in parametric statistics and multivariate ordination. To quantify behavior of BB data in 1-way ANOVA, we conducted a series of data simulations using percent cover, BB scores and 3 metric-scale transformations as competing dependent variables in iterated 2-group contrasts. Simulations followed the design of the Fisheries Habitat Assessment Program (FHAP) and covered full ranges of withinand between-group variation. We empirically estimated Type I error and proportional deviance in effect size as measures of performance. Finally, we compared 6 yr of FHAP data to the simulations to identify scenarios likely to be encountered by seagrass ecologists. BB scores performed well as a proxy for continuous data and log-linear transformation allowed more precise effect size estimation.

The rapid advancement in genome sequencing techniques allows the dissection of complex traits of non-model organisms of importance in evolutionary biology, conservation genetics, breeding and medicine. This advancement requires new statistical analysis tools that can handle large amount of sequencing data efficiently.        2. We propose an analytic Bayesian implementation of the mixed linear model which allows rapid and robust inferences of heritability. The two main features of the method are (i) breeding values and residual variance component are analytically integrated out of the model and (ii) the parameter space of the variance ratio parameter is discretized so that a Gibbs sampling distribution can be utilized. We propose further two separate methods to infer breeding values that acknowledge uncertainty of the learned heritability. The benefit of the method compared to a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is visualized on public data sets: two simulated data sets and one Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) pedigree.        3. Results show that while the accuracy of inferred heritability obtained by the proposed and standard methods are almost identical, the computational performance is very encouraging: up to hundred fold speed up and the possibility to make parallel implementation is particularly appealing here, which may further speed up computations.        4. The method allows analysis using a non-invertible relationship matrix so that ad hoc manipulation is avoided which can be important as our results imply. We completely avoid convergence and mixing problems here: this is a well-known problem of MCMC simulation, which sometimes can severely reduce the inferential power.

Wildlife scientists continue to be interested in studying ways to quantify how the movements of animals are interdependent - dynamic interaction. While a number of applied studies of dynamic interaction exist, little is known about the comparative effectiveness and applicability of available methods used for quantifying interactions between animals.        2. We highlight the formulation, implementation and interpretation of a suite of eight currently available indices of dynamic interaction. Point-and path-based approaches are contrasted to demonstrate differences between methods and underlying assumptions on telemetry data.        3. Correlated and biased correlated random walks were simulated at a range of sampling resolutions to generate scenarios with dynamic interaction present and absent. We evaluate the effectiveness of each index at identifying different types of interactive behaviour at each sampling resolution. Each index is then applied to an empirical telemetry data set of three whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) dyads.        4. Results from the simulated data show that three indices of dynamic interaction reliant on statistical testing procedures are susceptible to Type I error, which increases at fine sampling resolutions. In the white-tailed deer examples, a recently developed index for quantifying local-level cohesive movement behaviour (the di index) provides revealing information on the presence of infrequent and varying interactions in space and time.        5. Point-based approaches implemented with finely sampled telemetry data overestimate the presence of interactions (Type I errors). Indices producing only a single global statistic (7 of the 8 indices) are unable to quantify infrequent and varying interactions through time. The quantification of infrequent and variable interactive behaviour has important implications for the spread of disease and the prevalence of social behaviour in wildlife. Guidelines are presented to inform researchers wishing to study dynamic interaction patterns in their own telemetry data sets.

Numbers of individuals or species are often recorded to test for variations in abundance or richness between treatments, habitat types, ecosystem management types, experimental treatments, time periods, etc. However, a difference in mean detectability among treatments is likely to lead to the erroneous conclusion that mean abundance differs among treatments. No guidelines exist to determine the maximum acceptable difference in detectability.        2. In this study, we simulated count data with imperfect detectability for two treatments with identical mean abundance (N) and number of plots (n(plots)) but different mean detectability (p). We then estimated the risk of erroneously concluding that N differed between treatments because the difference in p was ignored. The magnitude of the risk depended on p, Nand nplots.        3. Our simulations showed that even small differences in p can dramatically increase this risk. A detectability difference as small as 4-8% can lead to a 50-90% risk of erroneously concluding that a significant difference in N exists among treatments with identical N = 50 and n(plots) = 50. Yet, differences in p of this magnitude among treatments or along gradients are commonplace in ecological studies.        4. Fortunately, simple methods of accounting for imperfect detectability prove effective at removing detectability difference between treatments.        5. Considering the high sensitivity of statistical tests to detectability differences among treatments, we conclude that accounting for detectability by setting up a replicated design, applied to at least part of the design scheme and analysing data with appropriate statistical tools, is always worthwhile when comparing count data (abundance, richness).",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  57     Total Times Cited:  58     Cited Reference Count:  40,10.1111/j.2041-210X.2011.00142.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),biodiversity monitoring;capture-mark-recapture;comparative studies;detection probability;nonparametric estimator;population size;sampling design;simulations;type I error;ESTIMATING SPECIES RICHNESS;CAPTURE-RECAPTURE MODELS;POPULATION-SIZE;DETECTION PROBABILITY;MONITORING PROGRAMS;MIXTURE-MODELS;POINT COUNTS;ABUNDANCE;OCCUPANCY;PRECISION,,

However, using landscape genetics in poorly understood species presents a number of challenges, namely, limited life history information for the focal population and spatially biased sampling. Both obstacles can reduce power in statistics, particularly in individual-based studies. In this study, we genotyped 233 American badgers in Wisconsin at 12 microsatellite loci to identify alternative statistical approaches that can be applied to poorly understood species in an individual-based framework. Badgers are protected in Wisconsin owing to an overall lack in life history information, so our study utilized partial redundancy analysis (RDA) and spatially lagged regressions to quantify how three landscape factors (Wisconsin River, Ecoregions and land cover) impacted gene flow. We also performed simulations to quantify errors created by spatially biased sampling. Statistical analyses first found that geographic distance was an important influence on gene flow, mainly driven by fine-scale positive spatial autocorrelations. After controlling for geographic distance, both RDA and regressions found that Wisconsin River and Agriculture were correlated with genetic differentiation. However, only Agriculture had an acceptable type I error rate (3-5%) to be considered biologically relevant.

We suggest that this reluctance is due in large part to the unsuitability of simple methods of power analysis (broadly defined as any attempt to quantify prospectively the informativeness' of a study) for the complex models commonly used in EE research. With the aim of encouraging the use of power analysis, we present simulation from generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) as a flexible and accessible approach to power analysis that can account for random effects, overdispersion and diverse response distributions. We illustrate the benefits of simulation-based power analysis in two research scenarios: estimating the precision of a survey to estimate tick burdens on grouse chicks and estimating the power of a trial to compare the efficacy of insecticide-treated nets in malaria mosquito control. We provide a freely available R function, sim.glmm, for simulating from GLMMs. Analysis of simulated data revealed that the effects of accounting for realistic levels of random effects and overdispersion on power and precision estimates were substantial, with correspondingly severe implications for study design in the form of up to fivefold increases in sampling effort. We also show the utility of simulations for identifying scenarios where GLMM-fitting methods can perform poorly.

Restricted randomization methods can account for the effect of spatial autocorrelation in the observed data by building it into an empirical null model for hypothesis testing. This can be achieved, for example, based on conditional simulation, which fits a highly parameterized geostatistical model to the observed spatial structure, or, for data observed on a regular transect or grid, with Fourier spectral randomization methods that can flexibly model spatial structure at any scale. This study uses Moran eigenvector maps to extend spectral randomization to irregularly spaced samples. We present different algorithms to perform restricted randomization to suit different types of research questions: individual randomization of each variable, joint randomization of a group of variables while keeping within-group correlations fixed, and randomization with a fixed correlation between original data and randomized replicates (e.g. as input for simulation studies). The performance of the proposed Moran spectral randomization methods for regularly and irregularly spaced samples is assessed with correlation analysis of simulated data. Moran spectral randomization closely matched the spatial structure of original simulated data sets, with identical or nearly identical Moran's I values and power spectra, depending on the algorithm. In correlation analysis of two spatially autocorrelated variables, Moran spectral randomization produced correct type I error rates for stationary spatial data, even for very small and highly irregular samples, but was sensitive to linear trend. When one or both variables lacked spatial structure, Moran spectral randomization tests were more conservative than correlation t-tests. The proposed Moran spectral randomization method requires a minimum of parameterization and is able to address multivariate data with spatial structure at multiple scales, with the option of controlling levels of correlation with the original data. It can provide technically unlimited numbers of randomizations even for small samples while closely maintaining the spatial characteristics of uni- or multivariate data at all spatial scales. The method is applicable for correlation analysis of stationary, autocorrelated spatial or temporal series. Further research should assess whether the method can be extended to multiple regression analysis.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  52     Total Times Cited:  52     Cited Reference Count:  34,10.1111/2041-210X.12407     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),correlation;Fourier analysis;Moran eigenvector maps;spatial autocorrelation;time-series analysis;LINEAR-REGRESSION;ECOLOGICAL DATA;AUTOCORRELATION,,

Trait-based methods have emerged as the leading approach for quantifying functional community structure (convergence, divergence) but their potential for inferring assembly processes rests on accurately measuring functional dissimilarity among community members. Here, we argue that trait resolution (from finest-resolution continuous measurements to coarsest-resolution binary categories) remains a critically overlooked methodological variable, even though categorical classification is known to mask functional variability and inflate functional redundancy among species or individuals.        Innovation We present the first detailed predictions of trait resolution biases and demonstrate, with simulations, how the distortion of signal strength by increasingly coarse-resolution traits can fundamentally alter functional structure patterns and the interpretation of causative ecological processes (e.g. abiotic filters, biotic interactions). We show that coarser trait data impart different impacts on the signals of divergence and convergence, implying that the role of biotic interactions may be underestimated when using coarser traits. Furthermore, in some systems, coarser traits may overestimate the strength of trait convergence, leading to erroneous support for abiotic processes as the primary drivers of community assembly or change.        Main conclusions Inferences of assembly processes must account for trait resolution to ensure robust conclusions, especially for broad-scale studies of comparative community assembly and biodiversity change. Despite recent improvements in the collection and availability of trait data, great disparities continue to exist among taxa in the number and availability of continuous traits, which are more difficult to acquire for large numbers of species than coarse categorical assignments. Based on our simulations, we urge the consideration of trait resolution in the design and interpretation of community assembly studies and suggest a suite of practical solutions to address the pitfalls of trait resolution biases.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  89,10.1111/geb.13275,categorical traits;community assembly;comparative studies;continuous traits;convergence;divergence;functional diversity;FUNCTIONAL-DIVERSITY INDEXES;COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY MECHANISMS;INTRASPECIFIC VARIABILITY;PHYLOGENETIC STRUCTURE;CONVERGENCE;DIVERGENCE;DISPERSION;COEXISTENCE;REDUNDANCY;RESPONSES,,

Uncertainties in both parameter calibration and outputs co-exist in these models due to both the incomplete understanding of the system under simulation, and biased model structure. We used sensitivity analysis, including both screening and global variance-based methods, to explore these uncertainties. We applied these techniques to the widely used forest growth model Physiological Principles for Predicting Growth (3-PG2) using field data from 141 plots of anymbia maculata and Eucalyptus cladocalyx in Australia. The screening method was used to select influential input parameters for the subsequent variance-based analysis and thereby reduce its computational cost. We assessed model outputs including biomass partitioning and water balance, and the sensitivities of the soil texture group, which includes 7 parameters. We also compared the screening and variance-based methods, and assessed the convergence of the variance-based method, and the change in sensitivities overtime. Using these techniques, we quantified the relative sensitivities of each model output to each input parameter. The variance-based method exhibited good convergence and stable sensitivity rankings. The results indicated changes in input parameter sensitivities over longer simulation periods. The variance-based global sensitivity analysis can be very effective in calibration and identification of important processes within forest models. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional power analyses assume complete information, but the stochastic nature of behavioural sampling can mean that true and estimated networks are poorly correlated. Power analyses do not currently take the effect of sampling into account. This could lead to inaccurate estimates of statistical power, potentially yielding misleading results. Here we develop a method for computing network correlation: the correlation between an estimated social network and its true network, using a Gamma-Poisson model of social event rates for networks constructed from count data. We use simulations to assess how the level of network correlation affects the power of nodal regression analyses. We also develop a generic method of power analysis applicable to any statistical test, based on the concept of diminishing returns. We demonstrate that our network correlation estimator is both accurate and moderately robust to its assumptions being broken. We show that social differentiation, mean social event rate and the harmonic mean of sampling times positively impacts the strength of network correlation. We also show that the required level of network correlation to achieve a given power level depends on many factors, but that 0.80 network correlation usually corresponds to around 80% power for nodal regression in ideal circumstances. We provide guidelines for using our network correlation estimator to verify the accuracy of networks built from count data, and to conduct power analysis.

However, this approach has potential pitfalls: over conservativeness after Bonferroni correction, ignorance of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between neighboring markers, and power reduction due to overfitting SNP effects. So, multiple locus models that can simultaneously estimate and test all markers in the genome are more appropriate. Based on the multiple locus models, we proposed a bin model that combines markers into bins based on their LD relationships. A bin is treated as a new synthetic marker and we detect the associations between bins and traits. Since the number of bins can be substantially smaller than the number of markers, a penalized multiple regression method can be adopted by fitting all bins to a single model. We developed an innovative method to bin the neighboring markers and used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. We compared BIN-Lasso with SNP-Lasso and Q + K-LMM in a simulation experiment, and showed that the new method is more powerful with less Type I error than the other two methods. We also applied the bin model to a Chinese Simmental beef cattle population for bone weight association study. The new method identified more significant associations than the classical LMM.

Here, we developed a simulation framework to perform spatially explicit statistical power analysis of biological monitoring programs for detecting temporal trends in occupancy for multiple species. Using raster layers representing the spatial variation in current occupancy and species-level detectability for one or multiple observation methods, our framework simulates changes in occupancy over space and time, with the capacity to explicitly model stochastic disturbances at monitoring sites (i.e., dynamic landscapes). Once users specify the number and location of sites, the frequency and duration of surveys, and the type of detection method(s) for each species, our framework estimates power to detect occupancy trends, both across the landscape and/or within nested management units. As a case study, we evaluated the power of a long-term monitoring program to detect trends in occupancy for 136 species (83 birds, 33 reptiles, and 20 mammals) across and within Kakadu, Litchfield, and Nitmiluk National Parks in northern Australia. We assumed continuation of an original monitoring design implemented since 1996, with the addition of camera trapping. As expected, power to detect trends was sensitive to the direction and magnitude of the change in occupancy, detectability, initial occupancy levels, and the rarity of species. Our simulations suggest that monitoring has at least an 80% chance at detecting a 50% decline in occupancy for 22% of the modeled species across the three parks over the next 15 yr. Monitoring is more likely to detect increasing occupancy trends, with at least an 80% chance at detecting a 50% increase in 87% of species. The addition of camera-trapping increased average power to detect a 50% decline in mammals compared with using only live trapping by 63%.

Currently, at least 22 alpha-diversity and 10 beta-diversity metrics of community phylogenetic structure can he combined with nine null models (eight for Ii-diversity metrics), providing 278 potentially distinct approaches to test for phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion. Selecting the appropriate approach for a study is daunting. First, we describe similarities among metrics and null models across variance in phylogeny size and shape, species abundance, and species richness. Second, we develop spatially explicit, individual-based simulations of neutral, competitive exclusion, or habitat filtering community assembly, and quantify the performance (type I and II error rates) of all 278 metric and null model combinations against each assembly process. Many a-diversity metrics and null models are at least functionally equivalent, reducing the number of truly unique metrics to 12 and the number of unique metric + null model combinations to 72. An even smaller subset of metric and null model combinations showed robust statistical performance. For a-diversity metrics, phylogenetic diversity' and mean nearest taxon distance were best able to detect habitat filtering, while mean pairwise phylogenetic distance-based metrics were best able to detect competitive exclusion. Overall, alpha-diversity metrics tended to have greater power to detect habitat filtering and competitive exclusion than a-diversity metrics, but had higher type 1 error in some cases. Across both alpha- and beta-diversity metrics, null model selection affected type I error rates more than metric selection. A null model that maintained species richness, and approximately maintained species occurrence frequency and abundance across sites, exhibited low type I and II error rates. This regional null model simulates neutral dispersal of individuals into local communities by sampling from a regional species pool.

In recent years, multi-species occupancy models (MSOM) have been developed as a statistical tool to account for species-specific heterogeneity in detection while estimating true measures of diversity. Although the power of these models has been tested in various ways, their ability to estimate gamma diversity-or true community size, N is a largely unrecognized feature that needs rigorous evaluation.        We use both simulations and an empirical dataset to evaluate the bias, precision, accuracy and coverage of estimates of N from MSOM compared to the widely applied iChao2 non-parametric estimator. We simulated 5,600 datasets across seven scenarios of varying average occupancy and detectability covariates, as well as varying numbers of sites, replicates and true community size. Additionally, we use a real dataset of surveys over 9 years (where species accumulation reached an asymptote, indicating true N), to estimate N from each annual survey.        Simulations showed that both MSOM and iChao2 estimators are generally accurate (i.e. unbiased and precise) except under unideal scenarios where mean species occupancy is low. In such scenarios, MSOM frequently overestimated N. Across all scenarios, MSOM estimates were less certain than iChao2, but this led to over-confident iChao2 estimates that showed poor coverage. Results from the real dataset largely confirmed the simulation findings, with MSOM estimates showing greater accuracy and coverage than iChao2.        Community ecologists have a wide choice of analytical methods, and both iChao2 and MSOM estimates of N are substantially preferable to raw species counts. The simplicity of non-parametric estimators has obvious advantages, but our results show that in many cases, MSOM may provide superior estimates that also account more accurately for uncertainty. Both methods can show strong bias when average occupancy is very low, and practitioners should show caution when using estimates derived from either method under such conditions.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  40,10.1111/2041-210X.13378     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chao estimator;community richness;data augmentation;gamma diversity;imperfect detection;multi-species occupancy models;occupancy modelling;ESTIMATING SPECIES RICHNESS;CAPTURE PROBABILITIES VARY;NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION;POPULATION;NUMBER;SAMPLE;SIZE;CONSERVATION;BIODIVERSITY;PERFORMANCE,,

Bayesian implementation of spatially explicit models has received increasing attention from ecologists as Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods have become freely accessible. MCMC simulations offer a flexible framework for modelling extensive ecological data, but they also come with a wide range of problems regarding convergence, processing time and implementation. 2. We introduce to ecologists an alternative procedure for fitting Bayesian hierarchical spatial models (BHSM) with quite general spatial covariance structures. This procedure uses integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) as an alternative to MCMC. 3. We show, using a case study of species distribution model with binary areal data, that implementing BHSM with INLA does not require advanced programming skills, yields accurate results compared with MCMC and is rapid (e.g. a few seconds with small to moderate data sets). BHSMs efficiently removed spatial autocorrelation in the residuals and fairly evaluated uncertainty in parameter estimates and predictions. 4. The rapidity of INLA significantly decreased the processing time and allowed both sensitivity analyses on priors and cross-validation tests to be performed within a reasonable amount of time, which ultimately increased model transparency.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  47     Total Times Cited:  47     Cited Reference Count:  36,10.1111/j.2041-210X.2012.00211.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bayesian hierarchical spatial models;CAR model;Matern;MCMC;spatial autocorrelation;species distribution model;WOODLAND CARIBOU;MODELS;LANDSCAPE;PROBABILITIES;SELECTION,,

Monitoring spatial and temporal change in relative abundance using statistically powerful designs is a critical aspect of wildlife management. Many indices of relative abundance are available, but information regarding their influence on statistical power is limited. Aims. We compared the statistical power associated with occurrence-based and frequency-based indices derived from faecal pellet counts and camera trapping to detect changes in the activity of five mammalian herbivores. Methods. We deployed camera traps and counted faecal pellets in native vegetation subjected to four management treatments in south-eastern Australia. We used simulation coupled with generalised linear mixed models to investigate the statistical power associated with a range of effect sizes for each combination of species, survey method and data type. Key results. The index derived from camera frequency data provided the greatest statistical power to detect species' responses and was the only index capable of detecting small effect sizes with high power. The occurrence index from camera trapping did not provide the same level of statistical power. Indices derived from faecal pellet frequency data also detected spatial and temporal changes in activity levels for some species, but large numbers of plots were required to detect medium to large effect sizes. High power to detect medium to large effects could be achieved using occurrence indices derived from pellet presence-absence data, but required larger sample sizes compared to the camera frequency index. Conclusions. Both camera trapping and pellet counts can be applied to simultaneously monitor the activity of multiple mammalian herbivore species with differing activity patterns, behaviour, body size and densities, in open and closed habitat. However, using frequency indices derived from camera trapping may improve management outcomes by maximising the statistical power of monitoring programs to detect changes in abundance and habitat use.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  82,10.1071/WR21135,Axis porcinus;cost-effective;Macropus giganteus;mammal;management;monitoring;Oryctolagus cuniculus;sampling methods;survey methods;Vombatus ursinus;Wallabia bicolor;INFRARED DIGITAL CAMERAS;HABITAT SELECTION;DUNG COUNTS;WILDLIFE;MANAGEMENT;DENSITY;ABUNDANCE;FOREST;PREY;POPULATIONS,,

The life spans of animals can be measured in natural populations by uniquely marking individuals and then releasing them into the field. Selection on survival (a component of fitness) can subsequently be quantified by regressing the life spans of these marked individuals on their trait values. However, marked individuals are not always seen on every subsequent catching occasion, and for this reason, imperfect detection is considered a problem when estimating survival selection in natural populations.        2. Capture-mark-recapture methods have been advocated as a powerful means to correct for imperfect detection. Here, we use simulated and field data sets to evaluate the effect of assuming perfect detection ('naive methods'), when detection is really imperfect. We compared the performance of the naive methods with methods correcting for imperfect detection (mark-recapture methods, or MR).        3. Although the effects of trait-dependent recapture probability are mitigated when recapture probability is high, mark-recapture methods still provide the safest choice when recapture probability might be trait-dependent. In our simulations, mark-recapture methods had a power advantage over naive methods, but all methods lost statistical power at low recapture probabilities.        4. The main advantage of mark-recapture methods over naive methods is the ability to control for hidden trait-dependent recapture probability, as it is often hard to tell a priori if trait dependence is an issue in a particular study. However, when trait-dependent recapture probability is weak, naive methods and mark-recapture methods perform similarly as long as recapture rates do not become too low, and the main problem of survival selection studies is still low statistical power. We provide a R package (EasyMARK) alongside with this paper to facilitate future integration between MR methods and classical selection studies. EasyMARK provides the opportunity to convert the regression coefficients from MR-approaches in to classical standardized selection gradients.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  43,10.1111/2041-210X.12498     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),capture-mark-recapture;directional selection;mark;natural selection;selection gradients;simulation;stabilizing selection;PHENOTYPIC SELECTION;DIRECTIONAL SELECTION;CAPTURE-RECAPTURE;TEMPORAL DYNAMICS;NATURAL-SELECTION;SEXUAL SELECTION;REGRESSION;STRENGTH;EVOLUTIONARY;POPULATIONS,,

Long-term monitoring is vital for understanding how species are impacted immediately by megafire and subsequently respond over time. However, monitoring should be designed with sufficient statistical power to detect impact and recovery. In this study, we developed a simulation framework for optimizing the design of biodiversity monitoring programmes to detect population recoveries after megafire. Location Victoria, Australia. Time period 2019-2020. Major taxa studied Vertebrates. Methods We collated species distribution models for 45 priority vertebrates most likely to respond to management after the 2019-2020 megafires in Victoria, Australia. We combined these models with fire severity maps to optimize the location of monitoring sites in and around the fire footprint. We simulated the impact of the megafires on species distributions and modelled plausible recoveries over the next 10 years. Using estimates of detectability for a suite of preferred sampling methods, we simulated monitoring at pairs of burnt and unburnt sites to evaluate the statistical power to detect the modelled recoveries. We tested the sensitivity of power to alternative monitoring designs, rates of recovery and monitoring budgets. Results Priority regions to establish monitoring sites varied by taxonomic group. Power to detect population recoveries increased as the monitoring budget increased, as the recovery rate increased and when the proportion of sites in burnt compared with unburnt habitat increased. According to the optimal monitoring design, an AUD $9M budget could detect 90% of recoveries to pre-fire levels in 40% of species with >80% power. Power was highest for mammals, followed by birds, reptiles and amphibians. Main conclusions Our simulation approach allowed us to test the relative performance of alternative post-fire monitoring designs ahead of time.

The growing wealth of genomic data is yielding new insights into the genetic basis of adaptation, but it also presents the challenge of extracting the relevant signal from multi-dimensional datasets. Different statistical approaches vary in their power to detect selection depending on the demographic history, type of selection, genetic architecture and experimental design.        2. Here, we develop and evaluate new approaches for combining results from multiple tests, including multivariate distance measures and methods for combining P-values. We evaluate these methods on (i) simulated landscape genetic data analysed for differentiation outliers and genetic-environment associations and (ii) empirical genomic data analysed for selective sweeps within dog breeds for loci known to be selected for during domestication. We also introduce and evaluate how robust statistical algorithms can be used for parameter estimation in statistical genomics.        3. On the simulated data, many of the composite measures performed well and had decreased variation in outcomes across many sampling designs. On the empirical dataset, methods based on combining P-values generally performed better with clearer signals of selection, higher significance of the signal, and in closer proximity to the known selected locus. Although robust algorithms could identify neutral loci in our simulations, they did not universally improve power to detect selection. Overall, a composite statistic that measured a robust multivariate distance from rank-based P-values performed the best.        4. We found that composite measures of selection could improve the signal of selection in many cases, but they were not a panacea and their power is limited by the power of the univariate statistics they summarize. Since genome scans are widely used, improving inference for prioritizing candidate genes may be beneficial to medicine, agriculture, and breeding.

While it is known that life history traits such as length-at-age and fecundity will vary with population density, cost-efficient monitoring requires that these metrics be incorporated into monitoring programs only if their statistical power is high to detect change due to fishing. We present a simple computer-simulated power analysis technique to compare the ability of monitoring designs to detect changes in fish length-at-age and fecundity, after adding effects of exploitation. We developed a methodology for estimating statistical power from first principles using computer simulation techniques which can be applied regardless of the statistical variance pattern in the data. Statistical power increased when more fish were sampled and when larger effects were added. Initially, power increased rapidly by increasing the sample size, regardless of the effect added. However, after 40-50 fish were included in the sample, smaller increments of increased power were obtained; highlighting that a cost-benefit analysis would be necessary. When compared to exploitation experiments in the literature, the stock-specific power analysis used here was able to correctly predict the outcome (significant change observed or not) of the literature studies in most cases. This technique advances the ability of designers of monitoring programs to assess the efficiency of any type of monitoring metric. Further, the simplicity of this power analysis technique allows it to be tailored to different species, life history traits, or potential disturbances to the population.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  67,10.1007/s00300-014-1533-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Arctic;Fisheries monitoring;Life history;Exploitation;Computer simulation;WHITEFISH COREGONUS-NASUS;LIFE-HISTORY;BROAD WHITEFISH;SAMPLING DESIGN;FECUNDITY;FISH;POPULATIONS;EVOLUTION;LAKE;CATCHABILITY,,

This paper develops a methodology for producing soil property maps at a continental or national scale based on soil samples from continental or national soil surveys (especially geochemical baseline surveys) with a 2-70 km grid, soil maps, and Digital Elevation Model data. The proposed method consists of four major steps: 1) determining the overall trend of soil property distribution using the linkage method; 2) estimating the variation inside each polygon through an extended Inverse Distance Weighted interpolation based on both the environmental similarity and spatial autocorrelation with stratification; 3) integrating variations in the soil property with its overall trend; 4) re-estimating soil properties in transition zones by using a weighted average of soil properties estimated from soil samples from different neighboring soils to produce a continuous soil property map across soil boundaries. A case study using Soil Organic Matter content as an example was conducted in Jilin Province (190,000 km(2)) in China based on soil samples from a 8-32 km grid from the China Soil Pollution Survey, the 1:1 million soil map of China and Shutter Radar Topographic Mission Digital Elevation Model data. Independent validation indicated that the proposed method decreased the mean error, the mean absolute error and the root mean square error by 10-30% compared with two commonly used soil mapping methods, the linkage method and Inverse Distance Weighted interpolation. The SOM map produced by the proposed method improved defects in the maps produced through Inverse Distance Weighted interpolation and the linkage method such as ""bull's eye"" patterns, abrupt change across soil boundaries and the ignored variation inside polygons on the maps. The proposed approach generates more accurate soil property maps at a continental or national scale based on grid soil samples from continental or national soil surveys than those produced through commonly used methods.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  55,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101487,Combination method;Grid soil sample;Continental and national scale;Linkage method;Extended inverse distance weighted interpolation;Soil organic matter content;INFRARED REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY;CARBON STOCKS;SIMULATION;PREDICTION;NITROGEN;SYSTEM;GROWTH;SOTER,,

Many quantitative traits, for example body size, have been hypothesized to influence the diversification dynamics of lineages over macroevolutionary time-scales. The Quantitative State Speciation-Extinction (QuaSSE) model and related methods provide an elegant framework for jointly modelling the relationship between change in continuous traits and diversification. However, model misspecification and phylogenetic pseudoreplication can result in elevated false discovery rates in this and other state-dependent speciation-extinction models.        2. Here, we evaluate alternative trait-dependent diversification methods that do not formally model the relationship between traits and diversification, but instead test for correlations between summary statistics of phylogenetic branching patterns and trait variation at the tips of a phylogenetic tree (hereafter tip-rate correlations or TRCs). We compare alternative branching pattern statistics and significance tests, and we evaluate their performance relative to QuaSSE under a range of evolutionary scenarios.        3. We found that a simple statistic derived from branch lengths (inverse equal splits) can detect trait-associated rate variation, and that a simulation-based method performs better than phylogenetic generalized least squares for testing the significance of trait-rate correlations. This test (ES-sim) had better power to detect trait-dependent diversification than other TRCs. By testing the approach across a diverse set of simulation scenarios, we found that ES-sim is similar to QuaSSE in statistical power. However, the approach rarely led to false inferences of trait-dependent diversification, even under conditions that are problematic for formal state-dependent models. We illustrate the application of ES-sim to real data by reassessing the relationship between dispersal ability and diversification in Furnariid birds.        4. We conclude that simple, semi-parametric tests like ES-sim represent a promising approach for trait-dependent diversification analyses in groups with heterogeneous diversification histories and provide a useful alternative or complement to formal state-dependent speciation-extinction models.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  40     Total Times Cited:  40     Cited Reference Count:  56,10.1111/2041-210X.12949     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),comparative methods;inverse equal splits statistic;phylogenetic generalized least squares;state-dependent speciation and extinction models;trait-dependent diversification;R PACKAGE;SPECIES-RICHNESS;EXTINCTION RATES;SEXUAL SELECTION;CAUTIONARY NOTE;BODY-SIZE;EVOLUTION;PATTERNS;CONSTRAINTS;CHARACTER,,

Here we report a unique comparison of minimum detectable differences (MDDs) in SOC, and the estimated times required to observe those MDDs across the north central United States, calculated for the two most common SOC experiments: (1) a comparison between two treatments, e.g., moldboard plow (MP) and no-tillage (NT), using a randomized complete block design experiment; and (2) a comparison of changes in SOC over time for a particular treatment, e.g., NT, using a randomized complete block design experiment with time as an additional factor. We estimated the duration of the two experiment types required to achieve MDD through simulation of SOC dynamics. Data for the study came from 13 experimental sites located in Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Missouri, and Minnesota. Soil organic carbon, bulk density, and texture were measured at four soil depths. Minimum detectable differences were calculated with probability of Type I error of 0.05 and probability of Type II error of 0.15. The MDDs in SOC were highly variable across the region and increased with soil depth. At 0 to 10 cm (0 to 3.9 in) soil depth, MDDs with five replications ranged from 1.04 g C kg(-1) (0.017 oz C lb(-1); 6%) to 7.15 g C kg(-1) (0.114 oz C lb(-1); 31%) for comparison of two treatments; and from 0.46 g C kg(-1) (0.007 oz C lb(-1); 3%) to 3.12 g C kg(-1) (0.050 oz C lb(-1); 13%) for SOC change over time. Large differences were also predicted in the experiment duration required to detect a difference in SOC between MP and NT (from 8 to > 100 years with five replications), or a change in SOC over time under NT management (from 11 to 71 years with five replications). At most locations, the time required to detect a change in SOC under NT was shorter than the time required to detect a difference between MP and NT. Minimum detectable difference and experiment duration decreased with the number of replications and were correlated with SOC variability and soil texture of the experimental sites, i.e., they tended to be lower in fine textured soils. Experiment duration was also reduced by increased crop productivity and the amount of residue left on the soil.

I tested whether a variety of hypothetical but logistically plausible survey designs could provide statistically powerful assessments of hypothetical but empirically based population responses to megafire.        Location Simulation focused on fire-prone forests.        Methods I varied the number of affected sites, detection probability, baseline occupancy and species' responses to fire to create 72 monitoring scenarios. I then simulated 10 years of site occupancy data in which a megafire or other disturbance occurred between years 5 and 6 (n = 500 iterations).        Results Statistical power to correctly reject the null hypothesis of no population response to megafire was high (mean across all scenarios = 0.78), but power to identify the correct population response (e.g. post-fire occupancy declined and then recovered) was low (mean = 0.29). Statistical power to not underestimate the effect of a megafire on site occupancy was fairly high (mean = 0.66), but power to accurately estimate site occupancy was low (mean = 0.25). Statistical power increased with the number of affected sites (i.e., sample size) and with the intensity of the focal species' response to megafire. Case study simulations based on an existing acoustic monitoring programme in the Sierra Nevada, USA, indicate that it is likely to identify Spotted Owl and Black-backed Woodpecker population responses to megafires. Researchers can use the included simulation tutorial to implement their own power analyses.        Main conclusions Landscape-scale monitoring programmes can identify population changes following megafires, but cannot reliably produce nuanced results, especially with only five years of post-fire data. Smaller-bodied species, which could be studied at more sites, are likely to be better focal species for megafire BACI studies. Aggregating landscape-scale studies' sampling coverage across many fire footprints to study the overall effects of megafires-rather than the effects of individual fires-may be a more informative approach.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  44,10.1111/ddi.13308,acoustic survey;autonomous recording unit;bioacoustics;camera trap;non&#8208;invasive sampling;power analysis;simulation;statistical power;FIRE SEVERITY;OCCUPANCY;CALIFORNIA;MODELS;POWER;WOLVERINE;BIRDS;SIZE,,

Genomewide association studies (GWAS) enable detailed dissections of the genetic basis for organisms' ability to adapt to a changing environment. In long-term studies of natural populations, individuals are often marked at one point in their life and then repeatedly recaptured. It is therefore essential that a method for GWAS includes the process of repeated sampling. In a GWAS, the effects of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) need to be fitted and any model development is constrained by the computational requirements. A method is therefore required that can fit a highly hierarchical model and at the same time is computationally fast enough to be useful.        2. Our method fits fixed SNP effects in a linear mixed model that can include both random polygenic effects and permanent environmental effects. In this way, the model can correct for population structure and model repeated measures. The covariance structure of the linear mixed model is first estimated and subsequently used in a generalized least squares setting to fit the SNP effects. The method was evaluated in a simulation study based on observed genotypes from a long-term study of collared flycatchers in Sweden.        3. The method we present here was successful in estimating permanent environmental effects from simulated repeated measures data. Additionally, we found that especially for variable phenotypes having large variation between years, the repeated measurements model has a substantial increase in power compared to a model using average phenotypes as a response.        4. The method is available in the R package RepeatABEL. It increases the power in GWAS having repeated measures, especially for long-term studies of natural populations, and the R implementation is expected to facilitate modelling of longitudinal data for studies of both animal and human populations.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  29     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  45,10.1111/2041-210X.12535     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Ficedula albicollis;genomic relationship;hierarchical generalized linear model;single-nucleotide polymorphisms;FLYCATCHER FICEDULA-ALBICOLLIS;COLLARED FLYCATCHER;MIXED-MODEL;LONGITUDINAL DATA;MATE CHOICE;WILD;EVOLUTION;DIVERGENCE;SENESCENCE;SELECTION;Genome;Genomics,,

Nonetheless, meeting occupancy modeling assumptions and providing biologically accurate information are difficult tasks over long time periods, large areas, or when monitoring multiple species. In occupancy modeling frameworks, derived grids are commonly used to divide landscapes into discrete units. Grid sizes that match the home range size of the species of interest are considered optimal, but this practice is complicated as home range size may vary by sex, habitat quality, or among species. Additionally, studies often assume their survey methods sample an entire grid cell when the actual effective sampling area may be much smaller. The effect of reduced effective sampling area on occupancy estimation has received little attention to date, despite being flagged as a critical issue. In this study, we assessed (1) how the relationship between effective area, home range size, and grid size affects power to detect trends in occupancy; (2) how varying the sampling design factors of effective area, duration, detection probability, and resurvey interval influence monitoring efficiency; and (3) determine whether a single sampling design can simultaneously detect declines in two species with different home range sizes. We used a spatially explicit simulation framework to create biologically realistic declining populations over 10 yr and assessed statistical power to detect known declines using occupancy modeling. We found that effective area and detection probability had the greatest influence on statistical power. We could not reliably detect declines when detection probability was low or when effective sampling area was <1/4 cell. We conclude that failing to account for effective area less than the cell size will result in overestimation of statistical power. Our simulations suggest occupancy models can detect declines for two species with different home range sizes using the same grid cell size under certain conditions, for instance, surveying >25% of the landscape, >= 25% effective area, and fixed sampling locations. Further, increasing resampling interval greatly increased monitoring efficiency. Our results show monitoring planning requires explicit consideration of effective sampling area and methods with sufficient detectability to detect population declines.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  88,10.1002/ecs2.3519     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),bioacoustic monitoring;carnivore;effective area;Martes caurina;multispecies monitoring;non-invasive monitoring;occupancy models;passive monitoring;Pekania pennanti;population trend;remote camera;statistical power;ESTIMATING SITE OCCUPANCY;SPATIALLY-EXPLICIT;SIERRA-NEVADA;DETECTION PROBABILITY;AMERICAN MARTENS;PEKANIA-PENNANTI;FOREST BIRDS;HAIR SNARES;FISHERS;CONSERVATION,,

These tradeoffs may be behavioural (e.g. whether to focus on foraging or predator avoidance) or physiological (e.g. whether to allocate energy to reproduction or growth). Similarly, wildlife and fishery managers must make tradeoffs while striving for conservation or economic goals (e.g. costs vs. rewards). Stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) provides a powerful and flexible framework within which to explore these tradeoffs. A rich body of mathematical results on SDP exist but have received little attention in ecology and evolution. Using directed graphs - an intuitive visual model representation - we reformulated SDP models into matrix form. We synthesized relevant existing theoretical results which we then applied to two canonical SDP models in ecology and evolution. We applied these matrix methods to a simple illustrative patch choice example and an existing SDP model of parasitoid wasp behaviour. The proposed analytical matrix methods provide the same results as standard numerical methods as well as additional insights into the nature and quantity of other, nearly optimal, strategies, which we may also expect to observe in nature. The mathematical results highlighted in this work also explain qualitative aspects of model convergence. An added benefit of the proposed matrix notation is the resulting ease of implementation of Markov chain analysis (an exact solution for the realized states of an individual) rather than Monte Carlo simulations (the standard, approximate method). It also provides an independent validation method for other numerical methods, even in applications focused on short-term, non-stationary dynamics. These methods are useful for obtaining, interpreting, and further analysing model convergence to the optimal time-independent (i.e. stationary) decisions predicted by an SDP model. SDP is a powerful tool both for theoretical and applied ecology, and an understanding of the mathematical structure underlying SDP models can increase our ability to apply and interpret these models.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  44,10.1111/2041-210X.13291,backwards induction;Markov chain;Markov decision process;optimality models;stationary decisions;stochastic dynamic programming;value iteration;HOST SELECTION;CLUTCH SIZE;STATE;OPTIMIZATION;STRATEGIES,,

Large declines in the abundance of historically common species are now emerging as a major concern. Identifying declining populations through long-term biodiversity monitoring is vital for implementing timely conservation measures. It is, therefore, critical to evaluate the likelihood that persistent long-term population trends of a given size could be detected using existing monitoring data and methods. Here, we test the power to detect declines in Australia's common landbirds using long-term citizen science monitoring. We use spatially explicit simulations of occupancy dynamics and virtual sampling, designed to mimic bird monitoring in better-sampled regions of Australia, to assess likely power in these data to detect trends relevant for conservation. We predict the statistical power for 326 common species that meet minimum requirements for monitoring data across 10 regions of Australia, estimating the number of species for which we would have a high (>= 80%) chance of detecting declines of different sizes. The power to detect declines of >= 30% per decade was predicted to be high for at least one-third of the common species in 7 of 10 regions, with a total of 103 (32% of 326) unique species sufficiently monitored in at least one region. These species spanned 12 taxonomic orders, four orders of magnitude in body mass, and a broad diversity of dietary guilds, suggesting the current species pool will likely serve as robust indicators for a broad range of environmental states and pressures. Power was strongly affected by species' detectability, and power to detect even large declines was negligible when species are detected on <= 50% of visits to an occupied site. Predicted power for many species fell just short of the 80% threshold in one or more regions, which suggests an increase in effort targeting these species could greatly enhance the species and regional representation of these data. Against the backdrop of unprecedented biodiversity losses, this study shows how critical evaluation of existing monitoring schemes is valuable both for assessing the contribution of citizen science schemes to biodiversity monitoring and for designing strategic monitoring to significantly improve the knowledge these schemes provide.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  72,10.1002/eap.1918     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),abundance;biodiversity conservation;citizen science;detection probability;global change;power analysis;species populations;temporal trend;CITIZEN SCIENCE DATA;LONG-TERM;SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS;PRESENCE-ABSENCE;TRENDS;ABUNDANCE;CONSEQUENCES;EXTINCTION;RESPONSES;PATTERNS,,

Selecting an appropriate method to monitor animal populations can be challenging, particularly for low-detection species such as reptiles. This study compares 3 detection-corrected abundance methods (capturerecapture, distance sampling, and N-mixture) used to assess population size of the threatened Hermann's tortoise. We used a single dataset of 432 adult tortoise observations collected at 118 sampling sites in the Plaine des Maures, southeastern France. We also used a dataset of 520 tortoise observations based on radiotelemetry data collected from 10 adult females to estimate and model the availability (g0) needed for distance sampling. We evaluated bias for N-mixture and capturerecapture, by using simulations based on different values of detection probabilities. Finally, we conducted a power analysis to estimate the ability of the 3 methods to detect changes in Hermann's tortoise abundances. The abundance estimations we obtained using distance sampling and N-mixture models were respectively 1.75 and 2.19 times less than those obtained using the capturerecapture method. Our results indicated that g0 was influenced by temperature variations and can differ for the same temperature on different days. Simulations showed that the N-mixture models provide unstable estimations for species with detection probabilities <0.5, whereas capturerecapture estimations were unbiased. Power analysis showed that none of the 3 methods were precise enough to detect slow population changes. We recommend that great care should be taken when implementing monitoring designs for species with large variation in activity rates and low detection probabilities. Although N-mixture models are easy to implement, we would not recommend using them in situations where the detection probability is very low at the risk of providing biased estimates. Among the 3 methods allowing estimation of tortoise abundances, capturerecapture should be preferred to assess population trends.

Acoustic recording units (ARUs) require minimal cost and effort to deploy and inform relative activity, or encounter rates, for multiple species simultaneously. ARU-based surveys require post-processing of the recordings via software algorithms that assign a species label to each recording. The automated classification process can result in cross-species misidentifications that should be accounted for when employing statistical modelling for conservation decision-making. Using simulation and ARU-based detection counts from 17 bat species in British Columbia, Canada, we investigate three strategies for adjusting statistical inference for species misclassification: (a) 'coupling' ambiguous and unambiguous detections by validating a subset of survey events post-hoc, (b) using a calibration dataset on the software algorithm's (in)accuracy for species identification or (c) specifying informative Bayesian priors on classification probabilities. We explore the impact of different Bayesian prior specifications for the classification probabilities on posterior estimation. We then consider how the quantity of data validated post-hoc impacts model convergence and resulting inferences for bat species relative activity as related to nightly conditions and yearly site occupancy after accounting for site-level environmental variables. Coupled methods resulted in less bias and uncertainty when estimating relative activity and species classification probabilities relative to calibration approaches. We found that species that were difficult-to-detect and those that were often inaccurately identified by the software required more validation effort than more easily detected and/or identified species. Our results suggest that, when possible, acoustic surveys should rely on coupled validated detection information to account for false-positive detections, rather than uncoupled calibration datasets. However, if the assemblage of interest contains a large number of rarely detected or less prevalent species, an intractable amount of effort may be required, suggesting there are benefits to curating a calibration dataset that is representative of the observation process. Our findings provide insights into the practical challenges associated with statistical analyses of ARU data and possible analytical solutions to support reliable and cost-effective decision-making for wildlife conservation/management in the face of known sources of observation errors.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  31,10.1111/2041-210X.13831,acoustic data;count detection model;coupled classification;false positives;occupancy modelling;species misclassification;survey effort,,

Location Madagascar. Taxon Lemurs. Methods I collected climate and altitude data from WorldClim and summarized the niches of almost all living lemurs (83 species) into phylogenetically controlled principal components. To test for convergent evolution, I searched for multiple, similar climate optima using multi-peak Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models (surface, l1-ou, bayou). I compared the observed level of climate convergence to that simulated under neutral and single-optimum models. To test if behavioural or morphological traits were related to climate niches, I used phylogenetic regressions with activity pattern, diet, and body size. Results From an ancestral niche with high rainfall and low seasonality, four lemur lineages independently converged on climate niche optima characterized by high temperatures and low rainfall, supporting adaptive evolution in southwest deciduous and arid habitats. The observed level of convergence was more frequent than expected under Brownian motion and single-optimum simulations, which illustrates that the results are likely not a result of stochastic evolution over long time periods. Nocturnal and cathemeral activity patterns were common among lineages in the arid climate niche. Conclusion Lemur climate niche evolution demonstrated that convergence explains the distribution of four independent clades in hot, arid environments of southwest Madagascar. The timing of these convergent shifts coincided with the origination of modern arid-adapted plant genera, some of which are important lemur food sources. These communities have high endemicity and are especially threatened by habitat loss. Arid environments are arenas in which convergent evolution is predicted to occur frequently.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  90,10.1111/jbi.13741,adaptation;biogeography;desert;ecological divergence;primates;ORNSTEIN-UHLENBECK MODELS;FOREST FRAGMENTATION;CLIMATE;MADAGASCAR;PRIMATE;ADAPTATION;DEFORESTATION;BIOGEOGRAPHY;RADIATIONS;PHYLOGENY,,

Here, we report the results of the first simulation study, to our knowledge, specifically designed to examine the effects of heterogeneity of multivariate dispersions on the rejection rates of these tests and on a classical MANOVA test (Pillai's trace). Increasing differences in dispersion among groups were simulated under scenarios of changing sample sizes, correlation structures, error distributions, numbers of variables, and numbers of groups for balanced and unbalanced one-way designs. The power of these tests to detect environmental impacts or natural large-scale biogeographic gradients was also compared empirically under simulations based on parameters derived from real ecological data sets.        Overall, ANOSIM and the Mantel test were very sensitive to heterogeneity in dispersions, with ANOSIM generally being more sensitive than the Mantel test. In contrast, PERMANOVA and Pillai's trace were largely unaffected by heterogeneity for balanced designs. PERMANOVA was also unaffected by differences in correlation structure, unlike Pillai's trace. For unbalanced designs, however, all of the tests were (1) too liberal when the smaller group had greater dispersion and (2) overly conservative when the larger group had greater dispersion, especially ANOSIM and the Mantel test. For simulations based on real ecological data sets, PERMANOVA was generally, but not always, more powerful than the others to detect changes in community structure, and the Mantel test was usually more powerful than ANOSIM. Both the error distributions and the resemblance measure affected results concerning power.        Differences in the underlying construction of these test statistics result in important differences in the nature of the null hypothesis they are testing, their sensitivity to heterogeneity, and their power to detect important changes in ecological communities. For balanced designs, PERMANOVA and PERMDISP can be used to rigorously identify location vs. dispersion effects, respectively, in the space of the chosen resemblance measure. ANOSIM and the Mantel test can be used as more ""omnibus'' tests, being sensitive to differences in location, dispersion or correlation structure among groups.

We tested four landscape genomics methods on a simulated clinal population to determine their effectiveness at identifying a locus under varying selection strengths along an environmental gradient. We found all methods produced very low type I error rates across all selection strengths, but elevated type II error rates under weak selection.

We used field-parameterized simulation models to examine the effects of different errors on monitoring power and compared alternative methods used with two species of threatened pteropodids (flying-foxes), Pteropus conspicillatus and P. poliocephalus, whose mobility violates assumptions of closure on short and long timescales. The influence of three errors on time to 80% statistical power was assessed using a Monte Carlo approach. The errors were: (1) failure to count all animals at a roost, (2) errors associated with enumeration, and (3) variability in the proportion of the population counted due to the movement of individuals between roosts. Even with perfect accuracy and precision for these errors only marginal improvements in power accrued (similar to 1%), with one exception. Improving certainty in the proportion of the population being counted reduced time to detection of a decline by over 6 yr (43%) for fly-out counts and almost 10 yr (71%) for walk-through counts. This error derives from the movement of animals between known and unknown roost sites, violating assumptions of population closure, and because it applies to the entire population, it dominates all other sources of error. Similar errors will accrue in monitoring of a wide variety of highly mobile species and will also result from population redistribution under climate change. The greatest improvements in monitoring performance of highly mobile species accrue through an improved understanding of the proportion of the population being counted, and consequently monitoring of such species must be done at the scale of the species or population range, not at the local level.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.1890/11-0132.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Australia;flying-fox;population monitoring;population trend;power analysis;Pteropodidae;simulation modeling;HEADED FLYING-FOXES;ESTIMATING SITE OCCUPANCY;PTEROPUS-POLIOCEPHALUS;STATISTICAL POWER;POPULATION TRENDS;PTEROPODIDAE;MOVEMENTS;ABUNDANCE;COUNTS;REDISTRIBUTION,,

Evaluating predator management efficacy is difficult, especially when resources are limited. Carefully designing monitoring programs in advance is critical for data collection that is sufficient to evaluate management success and to inform decisions.        Aims. The aim was to investigate how the design of camera trap studies can affect the ability to reliably detect changes in red fox (Vulpes vulpes) activity over space and time. Specifically, to examine the effect of study duration, camera cost and detection zone under various environmental and management scenarios, including different fox densities, management impacts, monitoring budgets and levels of spatial and temporal variation.

A generalised linear mixed model was used to analyse simulated datasets from control sites and sites with predator management actions implemented, following a before-after or control-impact sampling design. Statistical power analyses were conducted to evaluate whether a change in fox abundance could be detected across various environmental and management scenarios.        Key results. Results showed that a before-after sampling design is less sensitive than a control-impact sampling design to the number of cameras used for monitoring. However, a before-after sampling design requires a longer monitoring period to achieve a satisfactory level of power, due to higher sensitivity to study duration. Given a fixed budget, there can be a trade-off between purchasing a small number of high quality cameras with large detection zones, or a larger number of cameras with smaller detection zones. In a control-impact design we found that if spatial heterogeneity was high, a larger number of cameras with smaller detection zones provided more power to detect a difference in fox abundance.        Conclusion. This simulation-based approach demonstrates the importance of exploring various monitoring designs to detect the effect of predator management across plausible environmental and budgetary scenarios.        Implications. The present study informs the monitoring design of an adaptive management program that aims to understand the role of managing fox predation on malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata), a threatened Australian bird. Furthermore, this approach provides a useful guide for developing cost-effective camera trap monitoring studies to assess efficacy of conservation management programs. Power analyses are an essential step for designing efficient monitoring, and indicate the strength of ecological signals that can realistically be detected through the noise of spatial and temporal heterogeneity under various budgetary constraints.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  61,10.1071/WR17139     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),camera traps;Leipoa ocellata;power analysis;red fox;Vulpes vulpes;FOX VULPES-VULPES;RED FOXES;RELATIVE ABUNDANCE;ANIMAL DENSITY;MAMMALS;PEST;CONSERVATION;AUSTRALIA;RESPONSES;IMPACT;Prednisolone,,

The recent expansion of continuous-resighting telemetry methods (e.g. acoustic receivers, PIT tag antennae) has created a class of ecological data not well suited for traditional mark-recapture statistics. Estimating survival when continuous recapture data is available ensues a practical problem, because classical capture-recapture models were derived under a discrete sampling scheme that assumes sampling events are instantaneous with respect to the interval between events.        2. To investigate the use of continuous data in survival analysis, we conducted a model structure adequacy simulation that tested the Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) and Barker joint data survival estimation models, which mainly differ through the Barker's inclusion of secondary period information. We simulated a population in which survival and detection occurred as a near continuous (daily) process and collapsed detection information into monthly sampling bins for survival estimation.        3. While both models performed well when survival was time-independent, the CJS was substantially biased for low survival values and time-dependent conditions. Additionally, unlike the CJS, the Barker model consistently performed well over multiple sample sizes (number of marked individuals). However, the high number of parameters in the Barker model led to convergence difficulties, resulting in a need for an alternative optimization method (simulated annealing).        4. We recommend the use of the Barker model when using continuous data for survival analysis, because it outperformed the CJS over a biologically reasonable range of potential parameter values. However, the practical difficulty of implementing the Barker model combined with its shortcomings during two simulations leaves room for the specification of novel statistical methods tailored specifically for continuous mark-resighting data.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  38,10.1111/2041-210X.12059     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Barker joint data;Cormack-Jolly-Seber;model structure adequacy;telemetry;TUNA KATSUWONUS-PELAMIS;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;MODELING SURVIVAL;TAGGING DATA;RECAPTURE;TELEMETRY;PARAMETERS;RESIGHT;MORTALITY,,

A specific case which has crystallized methodological questions is the 'orthologue conjecture', the hypothesis that function evolves faster after duplication (i.e. in paralogues), and conversely is conserved between orthologues. Since the mode of functional evolution after duplication is not well known, we investigate under which reasonable evolutionary scenarios phylogenetic independent contrasts or pairwise comparisons can recover a putative signal of different functional evolution between orthologues and paralogues. We investigate three different simulation models, which represent reasonable but simplified hypotheses about the evolution of a gene function trait. These are time-dependent trait acceleration, correlated changes in rates of both sequence and trait evolution and asymmetric trait jump. For each model we tested phylogenetic independent contrasts and an improved pairwise comparison method which accounts for interactions between events and node age. Both approaches lose power to detect the trend of functional evolution when the functional trait accelerates for a long time following duplication for trees with many duplications, with better power of phylogenetic contrasts under intermediate scenarios. Concomitant increase in evolutionary rates of sequence and of trait after duplication can lead to both an incorrect rejection of the null under null simulations of trait evolution, and a false rejection of the orthologue conjecture under orthologue conjecture simulations, by phylogenetic independent contrasts. Improved pairwise comparisons are robust to this bias. Both approaches perform equally well under rapid shifts in traits. Considering our ignorance of gene function evolution, and the potential for bias under simple models, we recommend methodological pluralism in studying gene family evolution.

Species-area relationships (SAR) and species-abundance distributions (SAD) are among the most studied patterns in ecology, due to their application to both theoretical and conservation issues. One problem with these general patterns is that different theories can generate the same predictions, and for this reason, they cannot be used to detect different mechanisms of community assembly.        2. A solution is to search for more sensitive patterns, for example by extending the SAR to the whole SAD. A generalized dimension (D-q) approach has been proposed to study the scaling of SAD, but to date, there has been no evaluation of the ability of this pattern to detect different mechanisms.        3. An equivalent way to express SAD is the rank-abundance distribution (RAD). Here I introduce a new way to study SAD scaling using a spatial version of RAD: the species-rank surface (SRS), which can be analysed using D-q. Thus, there is an old D-q based on SAR (D-q(SAD)), and a new one based on SRS (D-q(SRS)). I perform spatial simulations to examine the relationship of Dq with SAD, spatial patterns and number of species. Finally, I compare the power of both Dq, SAD, SAR exponent and the fractal information dimension to detect different community patterns using a continuum of hierarchical and neutral spatially explicit models.        4. The SAD, D-q(SAD) and D-q(SRS) all had good performance in detecting models with contrasting mechanisms. D-q(SRS), however, had a better fit to data and allowed comparisons between hierarchical communities where the other methods failed. The SAR exponent and information dimension had low power and should not be used.        5. SRS and D-q(SRS) could be interesting methods to study community or macroecological patterns.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  61,10.1111/2041-210X.12417     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),multifractals;multispecies spatial pattern;species-area relationship;species-rank surface;COMMUNITY SPATIAL STRUCTURE;UNIFIED-NEUTRAL-THEORY;MULTIFRACTAL ANALYSIS;STRANGE ATTRACTORS;AREA RELATIONSHIPS;DIVERSITY INDEXES;DISTRIBUTIONS;BIODIVERSITY;MODELS;CONSEQUENCES,,

We then calculate a number of commonly used summary statistics of community structure in space and time and use random forests to evaluate their utility for inferring the strength of these three processes. We find that (i) both spatial and temporal data are necessary to disentangle metacommunity processes based on the summary statistics we test, and including statistics that are measured through time increases the explanatory power of random forests by up to 59% compared to cases where only spatial variation is considered; (ii) the three studied processes can be distinguished with different descriptors; and (iii) each summary statistic is differently sensitive to temporal and spatial sampling effort. Including repeated observations of metacommunities over time was essential for inferring the metacommunity processes, particularly dispersal. Some of the most useful statistics include the coefficient of variation of species abundances through time and metrics that incorporate variation in the relative abundances (evenness) of species.

The caveat has been mostly ignored in emergy evaluations, often because it is difficult to identify when or whether a transformity was produced at maximum empower. We developed the model TechnoPulse to explore the temporally dynamic relationship between transformity and empower. As TechnoPulse cycled through four distinct phases of birth, growth, decline and recovery, maximum empower was accompanied by minimum transformity for the production flow. Conversely, the period of minimum empower corresponded to maximum transformity. After the ""birth"" of the new energy form, the period of growth saw empower increase as tranformity declined. Since transformity is the reciprocal of efficiency, maximizing empower also increased efficiency. We found that the non-pulsing situation had higher empower than pulsing, but that pulsing maximized power and minimized tranformity (maximized efficiency). We found that the national production of electricity in the US followed the pattern observed from the growth portion of the TechnPulse simulation by maximizing empower and minimizing transformity over the period 1995-2006. A contrast of two methods for estimating the emergy yield of systems (emergy summation based on common practices and transformity multiplication based on using minimum transformity at maximum empower) applied to PV electricity production revealed starkly different interpretations for PV's role and viability as a primary source of electricity, but more importantly suggested that there is a easy rationale for employing each method. Finally, emergy evaluations can be improved by heeding Odum's original definition of tranformity and using the minimum tranformity corresponding to maximum empower. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Alternatively, sexing can be based upon morphometric analysis, which remains invaluable in remote field conditions such as Polar regions. Nevertheless, discriminatory power may be affected by methodological issues hampering comparison between/within studies, e.g. considering alternative analytical techniques or measurements taken by different researchers. We investigated the sexing potential of bill length, bill depth and body mass in adult Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae of known sex. We performed discriminant analysis on a large dataset of measurements (237 males; 264 females) taken from penguins marked between 1994 and 2001, at Edmonson Point (Ross Sea, Antarctica). In a second step, we accounted for measurements collected by different researchers through permuted discriminant analysis. We found moderate support for sex discrimination through bill measurements (77%). Considering body mass did not improve classification power substantially (78.2%), possibly because of confounding inter/intra-annual oscillations in body condition. Discriminant rate decreased when controlling the researcher effect (72.7% and 71.4%, respectively). Results were also confirmed by logistic (mixed) models. Simulations showed that reduction in sample size markedly increased uncertainty in classification power. Differences with previous studies achieving a slightly greater classification power for sexing Adelie penguins through morphometrics could be related to (i) our higher sample size and/or (ii) geographical, population-specific differences, e.g. lower degree of sexual dimorphism.

Their relative magnitude is crucial for evolutionary processes, as only the former may allow for adaptation. However, the importance of fixed heterogeneity in small populations has recently been questioned. Using neutral simulations (NS), several studies failed to detect fixed heterogeneity, thus challenging previous results from mixed models (MM). To understand the causes of this discrepancy, we estimate the statistical power and false positive rate of both methods and apply them to empirical data from a wild rodent population. While MM show high false-positive rates if confounding factors are not accounted for, they have high statistical power to detect real fixed heterogeneity. In contrast, NS are also subject to high false-positive rates but always have low power. Indeed, MM analyses of the rodent population data show significant fixed heterogeneity in reproductive success, whereas NS analyses do not. We suggest that fixed heterogeneity may be more common than is suggested by NS and that NS are useful only if more powerful methods are not applicable and if they are complemented by a power analysis.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  20     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  51,10.1086/684158     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chionomys nivalis;individual-based model;generalized linear mixed model;simulations;snow vole;statistical power;LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS;DYNAMIC HETEROGENEITY;SELECTION;HERITABILITY;VARIABILITY;REGRESSION;FRAILTY,,

As ABC evolves, various versions are emerging, but here we only explore the most accessible version, rejection-ABC. Rejection-ABC involves running models a large number of times, with parameters drawn randomly from their prior distributions, and then retaining the simulations closest to the observations. Although well-established in some fields, whether ABC will work with ecological IBMs is still uncertain.        Rejection-ABC was applied to an existing 14-parameter earthworm energy budget IBM for which the available data consist of body mass growth and cocoon production in four experiments. ABC was able to narrow the posterior distributions of seven parameters, estimating credible intervals for each. ABC's accepted values produced slightly better fits than literature values do. The accuracy of the analysis was assessed using cross-validation and coverage, currently the best-available tests. Of the seven unnarrowed parameters, ABC revealed that three were correlated with other parameters, while the remaining four were found to be not estimable given the data available.        It is often desirable to compare models to see whether all component modules are necessary. Here, we used ABC model selection to compare the full model with a simplified version which removed the earthworm's movement and much of the energy budget. We are able to show that inclusion of the energy budget is necessary for a good fit to the data. We show how our methodology can inform future modelling cycles, and briefly discuss how, more advanced versions of ABC may be applicable to IBMs. We conclude that ABC has the potential to represent uncertainty in model structure, parameters and predictions, and to embed the often complex process of optimising an IBM's structure and parameters within an established statistical framework, thereby making the process more transparent and objective.

However, multispecies surveys are prone to various types of observation error, including false-positive/false-negative detection and misclassification, where a species is thought to have been encountered but not correctly identified. Previous methods assume an imperfect classifier produces species-level classifications, but in practice, particularly with human observers, we may end up with extraspecific classifications including 'unknown', morphospecies designations and taxonomic identifications coarser than species. Disregarding these types of species misclassification in biodiversity monitoring datasets can bias estimates of ecologically important quantities such as demographic rates, occurrence and species richness. Here we present a joint classification-occupancy model that accounts for species non-detection and misclassification. Our framework accommodates extinction and colonization dynamics, allows for additional uncertain 'morphospecies' designations and makes use of individual specimens with known species identities in a semi-supervised setting. We compare the performance of our model to a classification-only model that discards information about occupancy and encounter rate. We illustrate our model with an empirical case study of the carabid beetle (Carabidae) community at the National Ecological Observatory Network Niwot Ridge Mountain Research Station, near Boulder, CO, USA. We also use simulations to evaluate model performance through validation metrics where varying fractions of the data are confirmed. The model supported imperfect classifier accuracy and favoured certain true species classifications strongly for some morphospecies. The model outperformed (e.g. precision) the reduced model that discarded occupancy information, and these differences were most pronounced for abundant species. Spatial and temporal dynamics from modelled occupancy and encounter rates may inform species misclassification probability, but this idea has not yet been tested. Our statistical framework explores this opportunity, and can be applied to datasets with imperfect species detection and classification, limited verification data and non-species classifications.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  30,10.1111/2041-210X.13858,carabid;imperfect classifier;morphospecies;NEON;observation error;occupancy models;semi-supervised;species misclassification;MODELS;FRAMEWORK;ERRORS,,

Additionally, a by-product of denitrification, nitrous oxide, is a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. However, the estimation of denitrification rates is usually clouded with uncertainty, mainly due to high spatial and temporal variations, as well as complex regulating factors within wetlands. This hampers the development of general mechanistic models for denitrification as well, as most previously developed models were empirical or exhibited low predictability with numerous assumptions. In this study, we tested Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as an alternative to classic empirical models for simulating denitrification rates in wetlands. ANN, multiple linear regression (MLR) with two different methods, and simplified mechanistic models were applied to estimate the denitrification rates of 2-year observations in a mesocosm-scale constructed wetland system. MLR and simplified mechanistic models resulted in lower prediction power and higher residuals compared to ANN. Although the stepwise linear regression model estimated similar average values of denitrification rates, it could not capture the fluctuation patterns accurately. In contrast, ANN model achieved a fairly high predictability, with an R-2 of 0.78 for model validation, 0.93 for model calibration (training), and a low root mean square error (RMSE) together with low bias, indicating a high capacity to simulate the dynamics of denitrification. According to a sensitivity analysis of the ANN, non-linear relationships between input variables and denitrification rates were well explained. In addition, we found that water temperature, denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA), and DO accounted for 70% of denitrification rates. Our results suggest that the ANN developed in this study has a greater performance in simulating variations in denitrification rates than multivariate linear regressions or simplified nonlinear mechanistic model.

The methodology used for integrating the MCMC technique into a pollutant fate and transport models was detailed. The uncertainties encompassed in the dissolution rate and in the adsorption coefficient of the herbicide mefenacet were greatly reduced by the MCMC simulations. In addition, an optimal set of input parameters extracted from the MCMC simulations accurately reproduced mefenacet concentrations in paddy water and paddy soil as compared to the original published dataset. Consequently, by simultaneously optimizing multiple parameters of environmental models and conducting uncertainty analysis, MCMC technique exhibits powerful capability for improving the reliability and accuracy of computer models.

In particular, we are aware of no tools allowing simulating spatially-explicit multistate Markovian movements constrained to linear features or conditioned by landscape heterogeneity, which hinders movement ecology research in linear/dendritic (e.g. river networks) and heterogeneous landscapes.SiMRiv is a novel, fast and intuitive R package we designed to fill such gap. It does so by allowing continuous-space mechanistic spatially-explicit simulation of multistate Markovian individual movements incorporating landscape bias on local behavior.ResultsWe present SiMRiv and its main functionalities, illustrate its simulation capabilities and easy-of-use, and discuss its limitations and potential improvements. We further provide examples of use and a preliminary evaluation, using real and simulated data, of a parameter approximation experimental method. SiMRiv allowed us to generate increasingly complex movements of three theoretical species (aquatic, semiaquatic and terrestrial), showing the effects of input parameters and water-dependence on emerging movement patterns, and to parameterize a high-frequency simulation model from real, low-frequency movement (telemetry) data. Typical running times for conducting 1000 simulations with 10,000 steps each, of two-state movement trajectories in a river network, were of ca. 3min in an Intel Core i7 CPU X990 @ 3.47GHz.ConclusionsSiMRiv allows simulation of movements constrained to linear habitats or conditioned by landscape heterogeneity, therefore enhancing the application of movement ecology to linear/dendritic and heterogeneous landscapes. Importantly, the software is flexible enough to be used in linear, heterogeneous, as well as homogeneous landscapes. Using the same software, algorithm and approach, one can therefore use SiMRiv to study the movement of different organisms in a variety of landscapes, facilitating comparative research.SiMRiv balances ease and speed with high realism of the movement models obtainable, constituting a fast, powerful, yet intuitive tool, which should contribute exploring several movement-related questions. Its applications depart from the generation of mechanistic null movement models, up to population level (e.g. landscape connectivity) analyses, holding potential for all fields requiring the simulation of random trajectories.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  51,10.1186/s40462-019-0154-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Connectivity;Dendritic ecological networks (DENs);Landscape heterogeneity;Linear habitats;Hidden Markov models;Mechanistic movement models;Individual-based movement simulation;Movement ecology;River networks;Resistance;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;MODELS;BEHAVIOR;LEVY;POPULATION;ECOLOGY;RANGE;WALKS;Bias (Epidemiology),,

Our simulations of flight energetics predicted that the cost of bony spurs-a specialised avian weapon-should increase with time spent flying. Bayesian phylogenetic comparative analyses using a global spur dataset corroborated this prediction. First, extant species with flight-efficient wings (which presumably fly more frequently) tend to have fewer or no bony spurs. Second, this association likely arose because flying more leads to more frequent evolutionary loss of spurs.

Assessing whether MPAs are having the desired effects on populations requires effective monitoring programs. A cornerstone of an effective monitoring program is an assessment of the statistical power of sampling designs to detect changes when they occur. We present a novel approach to power assessment that combines spatial point process models, integral projection models (IPMs) and sampling simulations to assess the power of different sample designs across a network of MPAs. We focus on the use of remotely operated vehicle (ROV) video cameras as the sampling method, though the results could be extended to other sampling methods. We use empirical data from baseline surveys of an example indicator fish species across three MPAs in California, USA as a case study. Spatial models simulated time series of spatial distributions across sites that accounted for the effects of environmental covariates, while IPMs simulated expected trends over time in abundances and sizes of fish. We tested the power of different levels of sampling effort (i.e., the number of 500-m ROV transects) and temporal replication (every 1-3 yr) to detect expected post-MPA changes in fish abundance and biomass. We found that changes in biomass are detectable earlier than changes in abundance. We also found that detectability of MPA effects was higher in sites with higher initial densities. Increasing the sampling effort had a greater effect than increasing sampling frequency on the time taken to achieve high power. High power was best achieved by combining data from multiple sites. Our approach provides a powerful tool to explore the interaction between sampling effort, spatial distributions, population dynamics, and metrics for detecting change in previously fished populations.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  70,10.1002/eap.2215,integral projection model;monitoring design;remotely operated vehicle;simulation;spatial point process;CALIFORNIA;RESERVE;FISH;CONNECTIVITY;POPULATIONS;ASSEMBLAGE;MODEL;Military Personnel,,

Genome-scan methods are used for screening genomewide patterns of DNA polymorphism to detect signatures of positive selection.

We present a new F-ST-based genome-scan method, BayeScEnv, which incorporates environmental information in the form of 'environmental differentiation'. It is based on the F model, but, as opposed to existing approaches, it considers two locus-specific effects: one due to divergent selection and the other due to various other processes different from local adaptation (e.g. range expansions, differences in mutation rates across loci or background selection). The method was developped in C++ and is available at http://github.com/devillemereuil/bayescenv.        3. A simulation study shows that our method has a much lower false positive rate than an existing FST-based method, BayeScan, under a wide range of demographic scenarios.

In this study we used population projection matrices to evaluate the conservation status of this species and we performed a systematic analysis of the effects of matrix dimensionality on the inferred demographic parameters. Results revealed that population growth rates (lambda) were 0.946 and 0.961 for the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 periods respectively, suggesting a declining population with limited persistence ability. Even when the highest elasticity values corresponded to the survival of adults, numerical simulations suggested that increases in either seedling establishment or fecundity could render lambda > 1. Our empirical-based analysis using raw demographic data revealed a clear trend for lambda values to decrease with increasing matrix dimension. Stasis and fecundity elasticities were also found to decrease whereas retrogression and growth elasticitites increased with increasing matrix dimension. These results are roughly insensitive to the method used to create matrices of different dimensions. For H. portoricensis, large matrices with narrow classifications were required to minimize variations in lambda, highlighting the need for large data sets to assess the convergence of results with matrix dimensionality. Our combined results emphasize that under current scenarios the ability of H. portoricensis for population growth is severely limited. Any management strategy designed for the conservation of this species should consider long-term monitoring of populations as well as programs that enhance seedling establishment and adult survival.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  39,10.1007/s10144-013-0378-1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Columnar cacti;Demography;Elasticity;Matrix dimension;Mona Island;Projection matrix models;DEMOGRAPHIC-ANALYSIS;COLUMNAR CACTUS;CACTACEAE;RARE;SIZE;ELASTICITIES;REGENERATION;PHENOLOGY;TRENDS;PLANTS,,

It is essential to investigate the urban metabolism of carbon emissions which is a main cause of global warming and most of it occurs in the process of production and living in urban areas. In this paper, a carbon emission metabolic network is established to explore the emission reduction strategies by modeling carbon dioxide flows and identifying the mutual relationships based on the input-output analysis. Specifically, Eff-Lorenz curve derived from the painting of Lorenz curve is developed to compare the efficiency of carbon emissions from different sectors. The newly developed method has been applied to Guangdong province to demonstrate its availability and benefit. It is revealed that carbon emissions mainly concentrated in the secondary and tertiary industries with electric power generation, manufacturing industry, domestic consumption and transportation ranking at the top. The competition relationship reveals good interactions in terms of emission reduction while a mutualism relationship provides effective pathways to mitigate carbon emissions between pairwise sectors simultaneously. In Guangdong province, upgrading the dean combustion technology in electric power generation and energy extraction sectors would drive other sectors to cut emissions and adjusting the production structure of the construction sector also contribute to achieve this goal.

As resource pulse has been recognized as one of the major factors influencing ecosystem structures and processes, it is important to investigate why nature pulses and what benefits an ecosystem obtains from pulsed resources. The main question of this study was that if a system could be exposed to either constant external resources or pulsed external resources of the same temporal average intensity, which resources would maximize power acquisition of a system. To answer the question, this study tested how matching of pulsed resources affects total empower acquisition of a system using numerical simulation models and a refined dynamic emergy accounting method. A producer-consumer model system was built and simulated by varying phases and frequencies of pulsed energy sources. It was hypothesized that matching of frequency and phase among two or more pulsed energy sources increases the empower acquisition of a system, compared with a system under constant energy sources. The simulation results showed that in systems of two energy sources, matching phases and frequencies of the pulsed energy sources involved in primary production is critical to increase total empower acquisition and consumer energy storage. The primary mechanism was that the matching of pulsed resources in phase and frequency promotes energy acquisition of primary producers that is further efficiently transferred for the production of consumers. Energy acquisition of consumers was strongly correlated with total empower acquisition of the system presumably because the consumers are in the high energy hierarchical position controlling the producers thus contributing to the total empower acquisition through the system.

Because estimates of population size and demographic parameters usually include errors due to imperfect detection, estimations of the strength of density dependence will be biased if obtained with conventional methods and lack statistical power to detect density dependence. We propose a Bayesian integrated population model to study density dependence. The model allows assessing the effect of density both on the population growth rate as well as the demographic parameters while accounting for imperfect detection. We studied the performance of this model using simulation and illustrate its use with data on red-backed shrikes Lanius collurio. Our simulation results showed that the strength of density dependence is identifiable and it was estimated with higher precision using the integrated population model than the conventional regression model. As expected, the conventional regression model tended to overestimate density dependence at the population level whereas underestimates at the demographic level, but the bias was small. The analysis of the red-backed shrike data revealed negative density dependence at the population level most likely mediated by a density-dependent decline in adult survival. This work highlights the potential of integrated population models in assessing density dependence and its practical application in population studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Likewise, most eggs and larvae of marine organisms are dispersed by oceanic currents. It was historically believed that the spatial scale at which dispersal occurs was orders of magnitude smaller for plants than for fish. However, recent empirical estimates of seed and larval dispersal suggest that these dispersal scales are more alike than previously thought. The modeling approaches used to simulate aerial and aquatic dispersal are also converging. Similar biophysical models are developed, in which outputs of Eulerian models simulating the main physical forcing mechanism (wind or currents) are used as inputs to Lagrangian models that include biological components (such as seed terminal velocity or larval vertical migration). These biophysical models are then used to simulate trajectories of the biological entities (seeds, larvae) in three dimensions. We reflect on these converging trends by first putting them into an historical perspective, and then by comparing the physical and biological processes represented in marine larva vs. terrestrial seed dispersal models, the data used for the models output corroboration, and the tools available to perform simulations. We conclude that this convergence offers the opportunity to bridge the gap between two scientific communities which are currently largely disconnected.

The most fundamental question that can be asked of a sample of circular data is whether it suggests that the underlying population is uniformly distributed around the circle, or whether it is concentrated around at least one preferred direction (e.g. a migratory goal or activity phase). We compared the statistical power of five commonly used tests (the Rayleigh test, the V-test, Watson's test, Kuiper's test and Rao's spacing test) across a range of different unimodal scenarios. The V-test showed higher power for symmetrical distributions, Rao's spacing performed worst for all explored unimodal distributions tested and the remaining three tests showed very similar performance. However, the V-test only applies if the hypothesis is restricted to one (pre-specified) direction of interest. In all other unimodal cases, we recommend using the Rayleigh test. Much less explored is the multimodal case with data concentrated around several directions. We performed power simulations for a variety of multimodal situations, testing the performance of the widely used Rayleigh, Rao's, Watson, and Kuiper's tests as well as the more recent Bogdan and Hermans-Rasson tests. Our analyses of alternative statistical methods show that the commonly used tests lack statistical power in many of multimodal cases. Transformation of the raw data (e.g. doubling the angles) can overcome some of the issues, but only in the case of perfect f-fold symmetry. However, the Hermans-Rasson method, which is not yet implemented in any software package, outcompetes the alternative tests (often by substantial margins) in most of the multimodal situations explored. We recommend the wider uptake of the powerful but hitherto neglected Hermans-Rasson method.

On the basis of previous studies, we make improvements and conduct discussion in detail by assimilating chlorophyll-a data into a simple NPZD model. When the spatially varying Vm (Maximum uptake rate of nutrient by phytoplankton) is estimated alone, new strategies are designed to optimize the step-length that is used to adjust the parameters preferably and the assimilation efficiency is improved. On the condition that the same step is employed, the reduced cost function (RCF), the mean error of phytoplankton in the surface layer (ME), the absolute average error (AAE) and the relative average error (RAE) of Vm between given and simulated values decrease obviously compared with strategy in previous work. How the distribution schemes of spatial parameterization and influence radius affect the results is discussed by utilizing the above strategy, and the optimal influence radius corresponding to each distribution scheme is obtained. On the basis of the above work, when the five key parameters are estimated separately, the two given types of spatial variations could be reproduced and the RAE are less than 3%.

We then explain different types of uncertainty (i.e. classical and Berkson error) and use two statistical methods that incorporate uncertainty in climate variables into SDMs by means of (i) hierarchical modelling and (ii) simulation-extrapolation. We used simulation to study the consequences of failure to account for measurement error. When uncertainty in explanatory variables was not accounted for, we found that coefficient estimates were biased and the SDM had a loss of statistical power. Further, this bias led to biased predictions when projecting change in distribution under climate change scenarios. The proposed errors-in-variables methods were less sensitive to these issues. We also fit the proposed models to real data (presence/absence data on the Carolina wren, Thryothorus ludovicianus), as a function of temperature variables. The proposed framework allows for many possible extensions and improvements to SDMs. If information on the uncertainty of spatial climate variables is available to researchers, we recommend the following: (i) first identify the type of uncertainty; (ii) consider whether any spatial autocorrelation or independence assumptions are required; and (iii) attempt to incorporate the uncertainty into the SDM through established statistical methods and their extensions.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  48     Total Times Cited:  49     Cited Reference Count:  50,10.1111/2041-210X.12217     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),climate maps;errors-in-variables;hierarchical statistical models;measurement error;prediction error;PRISM;SIMEX;PRECIPITATION;TEMPERATURE;RESOLUTION;REGRESSION;MAXENT,,

When q = 1, our measure reduces to the sample coverage (the proportion of the total number of individuals in the entire assemblage that belongs to detected species), a concept developed by Alan Turing in his cryptographic analysis. The sample completeness of a general order q >= 0 extends Turing's sample coverage and quantifies the proportion of the assemblage's individuals belonging to detected species, with each individual being proportionally weighted by the (q - 1)th power of its abundance.

Agriculture benefits from ecosystem services provided by mobile agents, such as biological pest control by natural enemies and pollination by bees. However, methods that can generate spatially explicit predictions and maps of these ecosystem services based on empirical data are still scarce.        2. Here we propose a generic statistical model to derive kernel functions to characterize the spatial distribution of ecosystem services provided by mobile agents. The model is similar in spirit to a generalized linear model, and uses data of landscape composition and ecosystem services assessed at target sites to estimate parameters of the kernel. The approach is tested in a simulation study and illustrated by an empirical case study on parasitism rates of the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella.        3. The simulation study shows that the scale parameter of the exponential power kernel can be estimated with limited bias, whereas estimation of the shape parameter is difficult. For the case study the model provides biologically relevant estimates for the kernel associated with parasitism of P. xylostella. These estimates can be used to generate ecosystem service maps for existing or planned landscapes. The case study reveals that predictions can be sensitive to the parameter values for the width and shape of the kernel, and to the link function used in the statistical model.        4. In the last two decades numerous empirical studies assessed ecosystem services at target sites and related these to the surrounding landscape. Our method can take advantage of these data by estimating underlying kernels that can be used to map the spatial distribution of ecosystem services. However, empirical data that can discriminate between alternative kernel shapes remain critical.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  35,10.1111/2041-210X.12972     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),biocontrol;conservation planning;natural pest control;pollination;source-sink dynamics;spatial distribution;spatial extent;statistical model;BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL;DISPERSAL;POLLINATION;LANDSCAPES;FRAMEWORK;CROPS,,

Contrary to previous studies, we focus on complex, hierarchical population structure and on polygenic selection. Additionally, we use a false discovery rate (FDR)-based framework, which provides an unified testing framework across frequentist and Bayesian methods. Finally, we investigate the influence of population allele frequencies versus individual genotype data specification for LFMM and the linear regression. The relative ranking between the methods is impacted by the consideration of polygenic selection, compared to a monogenic scenario. For strongly hierarchical scenarios with confounding effects between demography and environmental variables, the power of the methods can be very low. Except for one scenario, Bayescan exhibited moderate power and error rate. BayEnv performance was good under nonhierarchical scenarios, while LFMM provided the best compromise between power and error rate across scenarios.

For example, selection analysis can be used to predict changes in trait values, and by approximating selection, equations describing trait dynamics derived and evolutionary endpoints predicted. Here, we provide an overview of how these methods can be used to understand evolutionary dynamics and selection in a structured population modelled by an integral projection model (IPM). General expressions for selection are given, and we show how these can be approximated using eigenvalue sensitivities. Approximations for the dynamics of both the trait mean and variance are presented and compared to simulation results (IPMs and individual-based models) for monocarpic perennials. We describe how selection can be decomposed into components related to survival and reproduction and into components resulting from changes in demography versus changes in population structure. We show that, in an empirically based IPM, effects of changes in population structure can be a major component of the overall selection pressure. Most studies of selection in natural populations have focused entirely on selection due to changes in demography, so our results may help explain why directional selection is often predicted but no evolutionary response is observed. The endpoints of evolution, what we expect to see in nature, are explored using ideas from adaptive dynamics theory. The key methods are based on evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) and convergence stability. Efficient methods for finding an ESS are described. We then extend these ideas to function-valued traits, where it is assumed that an entire function can evolve, rather than a few parameters defining it. By combining theory for IPMs with ideas from several different fields, we show how the dynamics of ecologically complex, evolving systems can be understood.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  24     Total Times Cited:  24     Cited Reference Count:  69,10.1111/2041-210X.12487     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),evolutionary biology;microevolution;modelling;population ecology;population genetics;quantitative genetics;FUNCTION-VALUED TRAITS;LIFE-HISTORY;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;GENETIC-VARIATION;FLUCTUATING ENVIRONMENT;STRUCTURED POPULATIONS;OENOTHERA-GLAZIOVIANA;QUANTITATIVE GENETICS;VARIABLE ENVIRONMENT;FLOWERING DECISIONS,,

A question that has not been fully addressed yet in field assessments of fish stream connectivity is which conditions influence the detectability of road crossing effects. Failure to detect existing road crossing effects can result from shortcomings in sampling design that lead to low statistical power. Here, we propose general barrier dispersal models to allow for asymmetry in barrier permeability and changes in movement behaviours of fish confronting a barrier. Despite the increased realism of these ecological assumptions, it remains to be determined whether asymmetric barriers and altered movement behaviours can be unambiguously detected using mark-recapture trials. We used simulations within a modelling framework that explicitly incorporates barrier and behavioural effects to assess the statistical power of various mark-recapture sampling designs under different combinations of design and ecological constraints. Key insights from our simulations are that (i) the spatial extent of the study reach critically affects detectability of barrier effects; (ii) the number of recaptured individuals that cross a barrier has greater effect on detectability than the total number of recaptures on both sides of the barrier; and (iii) detectability of asymmetry in barrier permeability and of altered movement behaviours increases with both linear fish density and effect size.Synthesis and applications. The proposed dispersal models, incorporating asymmetric barrier permeability and changes in movement behaviours of fish confronting a barrier, are of broad importance in the quantification of habitat connectivity in streams and rivers. Our simulation approach provides precise guidelines for improving the sampling design by adjusting the spatial extent of the study reach based on a priori knowledge of ecological constraints.

Due to the characteristics of ecosystems and typical models thereof, such as non-linearity, high dimensionality, and low quantity and quality of observed data, this optimization task can be very hard for traditional (derivative-based or local) optimization methods. This calls for the use of advanced meta-heuristic approaches, such as evolutionary or swarm-based methods.        In this paper, we conduct an empirical comparison of four meta-heuristic optimization methods, and one local optimization method as a baseline, on a representative task of parameter estimation in a nonlinear dynamic model of an aquatic ecosystem. The five methods compared are the differential ant-stigmergy algorithm (DASA) and its continuous variant (CDASA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE) and algorithm 717 (A717). We use synthetic data, both without and with different levels of noise, as well as real measurements from Lake Bled. We also consider two different simulation approaches: teacher forcing, which makes supervised predictions one (small) time step ahead, and full (multistep) simulation, which makes predictions based on the history predictions for longer time periods.        The meta-heuristic global optimization methods for parameter estimation are clearly superior and should be preferred over local optimization methods. While the differences in performance between the different methods within the class of meta-heuristics are not significant across all conditions, differential evolution yields the best results in terms of quality of the reconstructed system dynamics as well as speed of convergence. While the use of teacher forcing simulation makes parameter estimation much faster, the use of full simulation produces much better parameter estimates from real measured data. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Non-random species sampling is the rule rather than the exception in phylogenetics, but most phylogenetic methods to infer macroevolutionary and macroecological processes assume that the tips of the phylogenetic tree are either completely sampled or randomly sampled. In this study, we focus on extending the popular BiSSE framework to better account for non-random sampling of species. The existing BiSSE correction (which we describe hereafter as the unresolved clade correction) cannot be used on trees with clades of more than about 200 species, or when lineages that originate near the root are not sampled.        2. We propose new correction that does not have these two limitations. To assess the performance of our correction relative to the unresolved clade correction, we simulate trees using a common sampling strategy in which representative species of higher clades (e.g. genera) are sampled to include in a phylogeny.        3. Compared to the unresolved clade correction, we show that our new correction gives less biased parameter estimates; has higher power but a slightly elevated false positive rate to detect state dependence in speciation and extinction rates; and is less sensitive to a failure to sample all extant groups of taxa. Over all simulation scenarios, our correction perform equally well under conditions where the unresolved clade correction is applicable and conditions where the unresolved clade correction is inapplicable.        4. Given that both our correction and the unresolved clade correction have their own advantages and disadvantages, we suggest combining the two corrections. This can be done by applying our correction to groups that exceed the size limit of the unresolved clade correction or to account for the uncertainties in the placement of the lineages that originate near the root.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  22,10.1111/2041-210X.12982     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),extinction;representative sampling;speciation;state-dependent diversification;trait evolution;TRAIT-DEPENDENT SPECIATION;DIVERSIFICATION;EXTINCTION;CHARACTERS;EVOLUTION;BIOGEOGRAPHY;ECOLOGY;LINKING;RATES;MODEL,,

The use of an occupancy-based method to monitor bear populations can be appropriate under certain conditions given the mechanistic relationship between occupancy and abundance. The form of the occupancy-abundance relationship is dependent on species-specific characteristics such as home range size and population density, as well as study area size. To assess the statistical power of tests to detect population change of Asian bears, we conducted a study using a range of scenarios by simulating spatially explicit individual-based capture-recapture data from a demographically open model. Simulations assessed the power to detect changes in population density via changes in site-level occupancy or abundance through time, estimated using a standard occupancy model or a Royle-Nichols model, both with point detectors (representing camera traps). We used IUCN Red List criteria as a guide in selection of two population decline scenarios (20% and 50%), but we chose a shorter time horizon (10 years = 1 bear generation), meaning that declines were steeper than used for IUCN criteria (3 generations). Our simulations detected population declines of 50% with high power (>0.80) and low false positive rates (FPR: incorrectly detecting a decline) (<0.10) when detectors were spaced at > 0.67 times the home range diameter (home-range spacing ratio: HRSR, a measure of spatial correlation), such that bears would tend to overlap no more than two detectors. There was high (0.85) correlation between realized occupancy and N in these scenarios. The FPR increased as the HRSR decreased because of spatial correlation in the occupancy process induced when individual home ranges overlap multiple detectors. The mean statistical power to detect more gradual population declines (20% in 10 years) with HRSR > 0.67 was low for occupancy models 0.22 (maximum power 0.67) and Royle-Nichols models (0.24; maximum power 0.67), suggesting that declines of this magnitude may not be described reliably with 10 years of monitoring. Our results demonstrated that under many realistic scenarios that we explored, false positive rates were unacceptably high. We highlight that when designing occupancy studies, the spacing between point detectors be at least 0.67 times the diameter of the home range size of the larger sex (e.g., males) when the assumptions of the spatial capture-recapture model used for simulation are met.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  87,10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e02075     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Abundance;Detection-non-detection;Density;Species occurrence;Population trend;False positive detection;Spatial capture-recapture;SLOTH BEARS;MELURSUS-URSINUS;HOME RANGES;WESTERN-GHATS;SUN BEARS;SPACE-USE;MODELS;CONSERVATION;DENSITY;HABITAT;Asian Continental Ancestry Group,,

The difficulty arises as genotype frequencies often vary in geographic space and across distinct environments. Those large-scale variations are known to yield false positives in standard association testing approaches. Although several methods alleviate this problem, no tools have been proposed to evaluate the power that association tests could achieve for a specific study design and set of genotypes. Our goal here is to present an R program fulfilling this objective, by allowing users to simulate phenotypes from observed genotypes and to estimate upper bounds on achievable power. The simulation model can incorporate realistic features such as population structure and gene-by-environment interactions, and the package implements a gold-standard test that evaluates power using information on confounders. We illustrated the use of the program with example studies based on data for the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana.

For the simulated data, the new tests reached performances close to the gold-standard test and could be reasonably used with measured phenotypes. Power to detect causal variants was influenced by the number of variants and by the strength of their effect sizes, and specific thresholds were obtained from the simulation study.

In this study, we propose an extension of the N-mixture family of models that targets an improvement of the statistical properties of rare species abundance estimators when sample sizes are low, yet typical for tropical studies. The proposed method harnesses information from other species in an ecological community to correct each species' estimator. We provide guidance to determine the sample size required to estimate accurately the abundance of rare tropical species when attempting to estimate the abundance of single species.        2. We evaluate the proposed methods using an assumption of 50 m radius plots and perform simulations comprising a broad range of sample sizes, true abundances and detectability values and a complex data-generating process. The extension of the N-mixture model is achieved by assuming that the detection probabilities are drawn at random from a beta distribution in a multi-species fashion. This hierarchical model avoids having to specify a single detection probability parameter per species in the targeted community. Parameter estimation is done via maximum likelihood (ML).        3. We compared our multi-species approach with previously proposed multi-species N-mixture models, which we show are biased when the true densities of species in the community are less than seven individuals per 100 ha. The beta N-mixture model proposed here outperforms the traditional multi-species N-mixture model by allowing the estimation of organisms at lower densities and controlling the bias in the estimation.        4. We illustrate how our methodology can be used to suggest sample sizes required to estimate the abundance of organisms, when these are either rare, common or abundant. When the interest is full communities, we show how the multi-species approaches, and in particular our beta model and estimation methodology, can be used as a practical solution to estimate organism densities from rapid inventory datasets. The statistical inferences done with our model via ML can also be used to group species in a community according to their detectabilities.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  19     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  52,10.1111/2041-210X.12856     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),community abundance models;data cloning;hierarchical models;maximum likelihood estimation;rare species;sample size estimation;tropical species;BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES;HIERARCHICAL-MODELS;SPECIES RICHNESS;ECOLOGY;DISTRIBUTIONS;DIVERSITY;INFERENCE;DYNAMICS;BEHAVIOR;RARITY,,

Recent work has focused on development of methods that integrate multiple streams of data to model species distributions. Combining sources of information increases spatial coverage and can improve accuracy in estimates of species distributions. However, when fusing multiple streams of data, the temporal and spatial resolutions of data sources may be mismatched. This occurs when data sources have fluctuating geographic coverage, varying spatial scales and resolutions, and differing sources of bias and sparsity. It is well documented in the spatial statistics literature that ignoring the misalignment of different data sources will result in bias in both the point estimates and uncertainty. This will ultimately lead to inaccurate predictions of species distributions. Here, we examine the issue of misaligned data as it relates specifically to integrated species distribution models. We then provide a general solution that builds off work in the statistical literature for the change-of-support problem. Specifically, we leverage spatial correlation and repeat observations at multiple scales to make statistically valid predictions at the ecologically relevant scale of inference. An added feature of the approach is that addressing differences in spatial resolution between data sets can allow for the evaluation and calibration of lesser-quality sources in many instances. Using both simulations and data examples, we highlight the utility of this modeling approach and the consequences of not reconciling misaligned spatial data.

We use simulation testing to evaluate the suitability of the proposed models for estimating COAs and compare their performance to that of the popular mean-weighted COA method for a variety of scenarios. We illustrate how the approach can be applied to correct for variable detection ranges by integrating data from moored test tags and demonstrate how accounting for time-varying detection probabilities can impact space use estimates by fitting the model to data collected from a black sea bass (Centropristis striata) on a receiver array off the east coast of the United States. The proposed model reduced bias in COA estimates, particularly when tagged individuals occurred along the periphery of the receiver array. The test tag-integrated model largely corrected the bias associated with receiver- and time-specific detection probabilities. When applied to the black sea bass detection data, the model revealed fine-scale movements not apparent when detection ranges were assumed constant. Spatial management practices for coastal marine species are often based on trends in space use inferred from passive acoustic telemetry data, which can be misinterpreted when factors influencing detection ranges are not accounted for. Our approach provides a general framework for estimating individual COAs that can be modified on a study-specific basis to ensure resulting patterns of space use reflect a species' movements and behaviour, rather than variation in receiver detection ranges.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  35,10.1111/2041-210X.13080     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),acoustic transmitter;centre of activity;detection range;latent spatial process;observation network;passive acoustic telemetry;tag-integrated model;CARCHARIAS-TAURUS;HABITAT USE;MOVEMENTS;ANIMALS;RECEIVERS;DESIGN;ARRAY;Telemetry;Acoustics,,

Effective wildlife habitat management and conservation requires understanding the factors influencing distribution and abundance of plant species. Field studies, however, have documented observation errors in visually estimated plant cover including measurements which differ from the true value (measurement error) and not observing a species that is present within a plot (detection error). Unlike the rapid expansion of occupancy and N-mixture models for analysing wildlife surveys, development of statistical models accounting for observation error in plants has not progressed quickly. Our work informs development of a monitoring protocol for managed wetlands within the National Wildlife Refuge System.        2. Zero-augmented beta (ZAB) regression is the most suitable method for analysing areal plant cover recorded as a continuous proportion but assumes no observation errors. We present a model extension that explicitly includes the observation process thereby accounting for both measurement and detection errors. Using simulations, we compare our approach to a ZAB regression that ignores observation errors (naive model) and an ad hoc approach using a composite of multiple observations per plot within the naive model. We explore how sample size and within-season revisit design affect the ability to detect a change in mean plant cover between 2years using our model.        3. Explicitly modelling the observation process within our framework produced unbiased estimates and nominal coverage of model parameters. The naive and ad hoc approaches resulted in underestimation of occurrence and overestimation of mean cover. The degree of bias was primarily driven by imperfect detection and its relationship with cover within a plot. Conversely, measurement error had minimal impacts on inferences. We found >30 plots with at least three within-season revisits achieved reasonable posterior probabilities for assessing change in mean plant cover.        4. For rapid adoption and application, code for Bayesian estimation of our single-species ZAB with errors model is included.

Biologists can use these signals to tackle questions related to the evolutionary processes underlying trait evolution, estimate the ancestral state of a trait and predict unknown trait values from those of related species (i.e. phylogenetic modelling'). Approaches to model phylogenetic signals rely on quantitative descriptors of the structures representing the consequences of evolution on trait differences among species. Here, we propose a novel framework to model phylogenetic signals: Phylogenetic Eigenvectors Maps (PEM). PEM are a set of eigenfunctions obtained from the structure of a phylogenetic graph, which can be a standard phylogenetic tree or a phylogenetic tree with added reticulations. These eigenfunctions depict a set of potential patterns of phenotype variation among species from the structure of the phylogenetic graph. A subset of eigenfunctions from a PEM is selected for the purpose of predicting the phenotypic values of traits for species that are represented in a tree, but for which trait data are otherwise lacking. This paper introduces a comprehensive view and the computational details of the PEM framework (with calculation examples), a simulation study to demonstrate the ability of PEM to predict trait values and four real data examples of the use of the framework. Simulation results show that PEM are robust in representing phylogenetic signal and in estimating trait values. The method also performed well when applied to the real-world data: prediction coefficients were high (0.76-0.88), and no notable model biases were found. Phylogenetic modelling using PEM is shown to be a useful methodological asset to disciplines such as ecology, ecophysiology, ecotoxicology, pharmaceutical botany, among others, which can benefit from estimating trait values that are laborious and often expensive to obtain.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  67     Total Times Cited:  68     Cited Reference Count:  50,10.1111/2041-210X.12111     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),comparative method;cross-validation;evolutionary models;graph theory;Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process;phylogenetic eigenvectors;phylogenetic modelling;phylogenetic signal;statistical modelling;trait values;STABILIZING SELECTION;INFORMATION;EVOLUTION;SIGNAL;TOXICITY;PATTERNS;MATRICES;RISK;SIZE,,

Additionally, we investigate how group dispersion across the phylogeny affects inferences, and reveal that highly aggregated groups generate strong and significant correlations with the phylogeny, which reduce statistical power and subsequently affect biological interpretations. We discuss the broader implications of this phylogenetic group aggregation, and its relation to challenges encountered with other comparative methods where one or a few transitions in discrete traits are observed on the phylogeny.

Standardized coefficients are typically used in such situations, with the goal being to compare effects on a common scale. Traditional approaches to obtaining standardized coefficients were developed with idealized Gaussian variables in mind. When responses are binary, complications arise that impact standardization methods. In this paper, we review, evaluate, and propose new methods for standardizing coefficients from models that contain binary outcomes. We first consider the interpretability of unstandardized coefficients and then examine two main approaches to standardization. One approach, which we refer to as the latent-theoretical (LT) method, assumes that underlying binary observations, there exists a latent, continuous propensity linearly related to the coefficients. A second approach, which we refer to as the observed-empirical (OE) method, assumes responses arc purely discrete and estimates error variance empirically via reference to a classical R-2 estimator. We also evaluate the standard formula for calculating standardized coefficients based on standard deviations. Criticisms of this practice have been persistent, leading us to propose an alternative formula that is based on user-defined ""relevant ranges."" Finally, we implement all of the above in an open-source package for the statistical software R. Results from simulation studies show that both the LT and OE methods of standardization support a similarly broad range of coefficient comparisons. The LT method estimates effects that reflect underlying latent-linear propensities, while the OE method computes a linear approximation for the effects of predictors on binary responses. The contrast between assumptions for the two methods is reflected in persistently weaker standardized effects associated with OE standardization. Reliance on standard deviations for standardization (the traditional approach) is critically examined and shown to introduce substantial biases when predictors are non-Gaussian. The use of relevant ranges in place of standard deviations has the capacity to place LT and OE standardized coefficients on a more comparable scale. As ecologists address increasingly complex hypotheses, especially those that comparing the influences of different controlling factors (e.g., top-down vs. bottom-up or biotic vs. abiotic controls), comparable coefficients become necessary for evaluations.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  25     Total Times Cited:  25     Cited Reference Count:  71,10.1002/ecs2.2283     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),binary response models;coefficients;logistic regression;path models;relevant-range standardization;review;standardization;statistics;structural equation modeling;COMMUNITY COMPOSITION;LOGISTIC-REGRESSION;TOP-DOWN;DIVERSITY;COEFFICIENTS;POPULATION;NETWORKS;LOGIT,,

These errors, even when occurring at an extremely low rate, can derail many genetic analyses such as parentage/sibship assignments and linkage/association studies.        Nonetheless, few robust and accurate methods are available for estimating the rate of occurrence of genotyping errors and for identifying individual erroneous genotypes at a locus. Methods based on duplicate genotyping are expensive, and estimate genotype inconsistency rather than error rate at a locus. Methods based on Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests have low robustness and low power, and apply only to those particular errors that cause excessive homozygosity. Methods based on pedigrees are powerful, robust and accurate. However, they rely on known and complete pedigrees that are unfortunately rarely available from natural populations in the wild.        I proposed a maximum likelihood method to reconstruct pedigrees from genotype data with errors occurring at a roughly estimated (presumed) rate. In this paper, I describe how to use the method and inferred pedigree in estimating allelic dropout (or null allele) rate and false allele rate jointly at each marker locus, in identifying the erroneous genotypes, and in inferring the most likely genotypes at each locus of each individual. I examine the power, accuracy and robustness of the method by extensive simulations, and demonstrate the usefulness of the method by analysing three empirical datasets.        It is concluded that, both pedigrees and the rates of genotyping errors at each locus can be reliably estimated from the same genotype data by the same likelihood method, when marker information is sufficient and some sampled individuals are first-degree relatives. The erroneous genotypes are however inferred conservatively, and are reliably detected only when they occur in large families and/or at highly polymorphic loci. Estimation of genotyping error rates per locus and identification of erroneous genotypes of each individual at each locus should be routinely conducted to assess and improve data quality, to highlight markers for optimization of genotyping protocols or for replacement, and to enable the integration of genotyping errors in a robust statistical analysis.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  30,10.1111/2041-210X.12859     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),allelic dropouts;false alleles;markers;mistyping rates;null alleles;parentage;pedigree;sibling;MICROSATELLITE GENOTYPES;HETEROZYGOTE DEFICIENCY;SIBSHIP RECONSTRUCTION;POPULATION-GENETICS;PARENTAGE;ASSIGNMENT;FREQUENCY;INFERENCE;POLYGAMY;ALLELES;Genotype;Pedigree,,

Palaeodistribution modelling and the fossil record might provide the spatial context for statistical phylogeographical analyses, allowing the generation of independent palaeoscenarios of demographic history that can be tested using coalescent models. In this study we generated independent demographic scenarios to examine geographical barriers to gene flow in a Neotropical swamp palm, Mauritia flexuosa, and assessed how climatic changes during the Pleistocene influenced its geographical distribution and genetic diversity.        LocationNeotropical wetlands.        MethodsWe sampled 257 adult individuals of M. flexuosa from 26 localities in the Amazon, Araguaia/Tocantins, Paraguai, Parana and SAo Francisco basins. The analyses were based on statistical phylogeography, ecological niche modelling and the fossil pollen record. The genetic data were based on polymorphisms in three chloroplast non-coding regions.        ResultsMauritia flexuosa presented low genetic diversity but significant genetic differentiation among populations from different river basins. The ecological niche modelling and demographic simulations showed that the pattern of observed genetic diversity for M. flexuosa probably reflects range retraction during the Last Glacial Maximum, leading to multiple refugia. In support of this, the fossil pollen record suggests that multiple refugia were present in Brazilian savannas, where M. flexuosa often disappeared during cold and dry periods across the last glacial cycle, returning during the wet phases. The periodic dryness in this region was driven by the latitudinal displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) across glacial/interglacial periods, which possibly affected the distributional dynamics of M. flexuosa during the Pleistocene epoch.        Main conclusionsOur results provide evidence that climate changes during the last glacial cycle were important determinants of the geographical distribution and demographic history of M. flexuosa across the late Quaternary period. In addition to the geographical barriers imposed by river basins, these factors have shaped genetic differentiation, as currently observed among lineages.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  48     Total Times Cited:  49     Cited Reference Count:  52,10.1111/jbi.12269     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Amazonia;Arecaceae;Cerrado;coalescence;Intertropical Convergence Zone;Mauritia flexuosa;multiple refugia;wetlands;NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL;CLIMATE;SOUTH;AMAZONIA;DYNAMICS;UNCERTAINTIES;INFERENCES;VEGETATION;EVOLUTION;EXPANSION;Pollen,,

Population abundance (local density) or growth (lambda) are the most sensitive metrics to change. We discuss the value in implementing spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR), the current gold standard for density estimation, and open population SCR (OPSCR) to monitor changes in density over time. We provide guidance for designing studies to provide estimates with sufficient power to detect changes. Because of the wide availability of camera traps and interest in their use, we consider six density estimation methods and their extensions developed for use with camera traps, with specific consideration of assumptions and applications for monitoring Asian bears. We conducted a power analysis to calculate the precision in estimates needed to detect changes in populations with reference to IUCN Red List criteria. We performed a systematic review of empirical studies implementing camera trap abundance estimation methods and considered sample sizes, effort, and model assumptions required to achieve adequate precision for population monitoring. We found SCR and OPSCR, reliant on ""marked"" individuals, are currently the only methods with enough power to reliably detect even moderate to major (20-80%) declines. Camera trap methods with unmarked individuals rarely achieved precision sufficient to detect even large declines (80-90%), although with some exceptions (e.g., situations with moderate population densities, large number of sampling sites, or inclusion of ancillary local telemetry data. We describe additional estimation options including line transects, direct observations, monitoring age-specific survival and reproductive rates, and hybrid/integrated methodologies that may have potential to work for some Asian bear populations. We conclude monitoring changes in abundance or density is possible for most Asian bear populations but will require collaboration among researchers over broad spatial extents and extensive financial investment to overcome biological and logistical constraints. We strongly encourage practitioners to consider study design and sampling effort required to meet objectives by conducting simulations, power analyses, and assumption checks prior to implementing monitoring efforts, and reporting standardized dispersion measures such as coefficients of variation to allow for assessment of precision.

However, a divide still remains between mathematical and empirical studies, their readership, and integration into the broader literature. Because insights from mathematical ecology are far more general than the techniques employed, limitations in communicating mathematical advances to a broad spectrum of ecologists have arguably hindered ecology's progress, particularly in confronting theoretical predictions with empirical experiments and data.

Unbiased variability in the estimates of these study-level error variances increases with the inverse of study-level replication. Here, we demonstrate how this variability accumulates asymmetrically across studies in precision-weighted meta-analysis, to cause undervaluation of the meta-level effect size or its error variance (the meta-effect and meta-variance). Small samples, typical of the ecological literature, induce big sampling errors in variance estimation, which substantially bias precision-weighted meta-analysis. Simulations revealed that biases differed little between random- and fixed-effects tests. Meta-estimation of a one-sample mean from 20 studies, with sample sizes of 3-20 observations, undervalued the meta-variance by c.20%. Meta-analysis of two-sample designs from 20 studies, with sample sizes of 3-10 observations, undervalued the meta-variance by 15%-20% for the log response ratio (lnR); it undervalued the meta-effect by c.10% for the standardized mean difference (SMD). For all estimators, biases were eliminated or reduced by a simple adjustment to the weighting on study precision. The study-specific component of error variance prone to sampling error and not parametrically attributable to study-specific replication was replaced by its cross-study mean, on the assumptions of random sampling from the same population variance for all studies, and sufficient studies for averaging. Weighting each study by the inverse of this mean-adjusted error variance universally improved accuracy in estimation of both the meta-effect and its significance, regardless of number of studies. For comparison, weighting only on sample size gave the same improvement in accuracy, but could not sensibly estimate significance. For the one-sample mean and two-sample lnR, adjusted weighting also improved estimation of between-study variance by DerSimonian-Laird and REML methods. For random-effects meta-analysis of SMD from little-replicated studies, the most accurate meta-estimates obtained from adjusted weights following conventionally weighted estimation of between-study variance. We recommend adoption of weighting by inverse adjusted-variance for meta-analyses of well- and little-replicated studies, because it improves accuracy and significance of meta-estimates, and it can extend the scope of the meta-analysis to include some studies without variance estimates.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  20     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  33,10.1111/2041-210X.12927     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),fixed effect;Hedges' d;Hedges' g;inverse-variance weighting;ln R;random effect;small sample;PSEUDOREPLICATION;ACCURACY;POWER;SIZE;Bias (Epidemiology),,

However, photoquadrat data handling is fragmented into several processing methods, and there is a scarcity of dedicated software tools that integrate all major analysis options. photoQuad is a new software system for advanced image processing of photographic samples, dedicated to ecological applications. The software integrates a series of methods for the extraction of species area, percentage coverage, or presence/absence information, including random point counts (RP), grid cell counts (CL), freehand regions (FH), and image segmentation-based regions (SG). These are simultaneously functional in a layer-based environment, further supported by a variety of tools for image enhancement, image calibration, automatic quadrat boundary detection, and management of user-specific species libraries. The paper documents the main features of photoQuad, and demonstrates its performance through the simultaneous application of the RP, CL, FH, and SG methods on identical datasets, and the comparison of errors in species area and coverage measurements. The simulated data used for reference are disk-shaped patches, whose area and density statistics are equivalent to three benthic species characteristic of Mediterranean coralligenous communities. The analysis indicated that measurement methods differed in area and coverage bias, as well as in their sensitivity to species size. Large patches were accurately measured by all methods in terms of mean scaled error, but CL and RP provided high error variance, and their performance deteriorated with decreasing patch size; the region-based SG and FH methods provided the lowest errors and were both robust to patch size. The image and quadrat calibration process showed no statistically significant effect on the outputs, although further analysis is needed to validate this result. Overall, photoQuad constitutes a powerful software for elaborate analysis of photoquadrat images, facilitating fast and comparable evaluation of the ecological information contained therein.

Another measure of population performance, realized population change ((t)) is an encompassing metric of population trend over a period of time; it is the ratio of population size at an end time period relative to the initial population size. Our first goal was to compare mean and (t) as summaries of population change over time. Our second goal was to evaluate different methods for estimating these parameters; specifically we wished to compare the value of estimates from fixed effects models, random effects estimates from mixed effects models, and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Our final goal was to evaluate the use of the posterior distribution of (t) as a means for estimating the probability of population decline retrospectively. To meet these goals, we used California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) data collected on 3 study areas from 1990 to 2011 as a case study. The estimated MCMC median s for 2 of the study areas were 0.986 and 0.993, indicating declining populations, whereas median was 1.014 for the third study area, indicating an increasing population. For 2 of the study areas, estimated MCMC median (t)s over the 18-year monitoring period were 0.78 and 0.89, suggesting 21% and 11% declines in population size, whereas the third study area was 1.22 suggesting a 22% increase. Results from (t) analyses highlight that small differences in mean from 1.0 (stationary) can result in large differences in population size over a longer time period; these temporal effects are better depicted by (t). Fixed effects, random effects, and MCMC estimates of mean and median and of (t) were similar (9% relative difference). The estimate of temporal process variance was larger for MCMC than the random effects estimates. Results from a Bayesian approach using MCMC simulations indicated that the probabilities of a 15% decline over 18 years were 0.69, 0.40, and 0.04 for the 3 study areas, whereas the probabilities the populations were stationary or increasing were 0.07, 0.22, and 0.82. For retrospective analyses of monitored populations, using Bayesian MCMC methods to generate a posterior distribution of (t) is a valuable conservation and management tool for robustly estimating probabilities of specified declines of interest.

To investigate the effect of study design on landscape genetics inference, we used a spatially-explicit, individual-based program to simulate gene flow in a spatially continuous population inhabiting a landscape with gradual spatial changes in resistance to movement. We simulated a wide range of combinations of number of loci, number of alleles per locus and number of individuals sampled from the population. We assessed how these three aspects of study design influenced the statistical power to successfully identify the generating process among competing hypotheses of isolation-by-distance, isolation-by-barrier, and isolation-by-landscape resistance using a causal modelling approach with partial Mantel tests. We modelled the statistical power to identify the generating process as a response surface for equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions after introduction of isolation-by-landscape resistance. All three variables (loci, alleles and sampled individuals) affect the power of causal modelling, but to different degrees. Stronger partial Mantel r correlations between landscape distances and genetic distances were found when more loci were used and when loci were more variable, which makes comparisons of effect size between studies difficult. Number of individuals did not affect the accuracy through mean equilibrium partial Mantel r, but larger samples decreased the uncertainty (increasing the precision) of equilibrium partial Mantel r estimates.

In theory, statistical comparisons of expected and observed patterns enable data-driven tests of assembly processes. However, so far this framework has fallen short in delivering generalizable conclusions, challenging whether (and how) diversity patterns can be used to characterize and understand underlying assembly processes better.

Results We find that most issues arise from an overly simplistic view of potential processes that influence diversity patterns, which is often motivated by practical constraints on study design, focal scale and methodology. We outline solutions for each pitfall, such as methods spanning over spatial, environmental or phylogenetic scales, and suggest guidelines for best scientific practices in community ecology. Among key future challenges are the integration of mechanistic modelling and multi-trophic interactions.

In many regions where crops are grown, daily weather data are not available. Alternatively, gridded weather databases (GWD) with complete terrestrial coverage are available, typically derived from: (i) global circulation computer models; (ii) interpolated weather station data; or (iii) remotely sensed surface data from satellites. The present study's objective is to evaluate capacity of GWDs to simulate crop yield potential (Yp) or water-limited yield potential (Yw), which can serve as benchmarks to assess impact of climate change scenarios on crop productivity and land use change. Three GWDs (CRU, NCEP/DOE, and NASA POWER data) were evaluated for their ability to simulate Yp and Yw of rice in China, USA maize, and wheat in Germany. Simulations of Yp and Yw based on recorded daily data from well-maintained weather stations were taken as the control weather data (CWD). Agreement between simulations of Yp or Yw based on CWD and those based on GWD was poor with the latter having strong bias and large root mean square errors (RMSEs) that were 26-72% of absolute mean yield across locations and years. In contrast, simulated Yp or Yw using observed daily weather data from stations in the NOAA database combined with solar radiation from the NASA-POWER database were in much better agreement with Yp and Yw simulated with CWD (i.e. little bias and an RMSE of 12-19% of the absolute mean). We conclude that results from studies that rely on GWD to simulate agricultural productivity in current and future climates are highly uncertain.

Multivariate statistical methods are optimal to analyze such data and are thus frequently used in ecology for exploration, visualization, and inference. Most approaches are based on pairwise distance matrices instead of the sites-by-species matrix, which stands in stark contrast to univariate statistics, where data models, assuming specific distributions, are the norm. However, through advances in statistical theory and computational power, models for multivariate data have gained traction. Systematic simulation-based performance evaluations of these methods are important as guides for practitioners but still lacking. Here, we compare two model-based methods, multivariate generalized linear models (MvGLMs) and constrained quadratic ordination (CQO), with two distance-based methods, distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). We studied the performance of the methods to discriminate between causal variables and noise variables for 190 simulated data sets covering different sample sizes and data distributions. MvGLM and dbRDA differentiated accurately between causal and noise variables. The former had the lowest false-positive rate (0.008), while the latter had the lowest false-negative rate (0.027). CQO and CCA had the highest false-negative rate (0.291) and false-positive rate (0.256), respectively, where these error rates were typically high for data sets with linear responses. Our study shows that both model- and distance-based methods have their place in the ecologist's statistical toolbox.

To raise awareness of sustainable land management and direct policy and research to mitigate adverse impacts, large-scale bird monitoring programmes are being used in Europe. New Zealand's first farmland bird monitoring scheme was established in 2004 to quantify bird abundance on 98 farms across three sectors (sheep & beef, dairy and kiwifruit). Distance methods were considered ideal because they minimised disruption by nuisance variables that affected detectability (most often observer and whether birds were seen or heard; less frequently, effects of wind, habitat and farming systems). However, distance defection functions could only be measured for half the species present on the study farms, and sampling uncertainty remained high for several of those species. Gradually more species with reduced sampling uncertainty can be added as sufficient detections are gathered to generate their global detection functions. This will likely increase the scheme's power to detect any ongoing decline, but simulations that combine sampling uncertainty with observed inter-annual variation in abundance are now needed to test whether population-decline thresholds can be reliably detected using the current and alternative survey designs.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  58,,detectability;distance sampling;effective survey width;sampling uncertainty;spatial scale;LOWLAND FARMLAND BIRDS;POPULATION TRENDS;FIELD-EVALUATION;BREEDING BIRDS;DISTANCE;INTENSIFICATION;DENSITY;ABUNDANCE;INDICATORS;COMMON;New Zealand,,

With the increasing availability of empirical datasets, emergent patterns can be inferred from communities by synthesizing how barriers filter and structure populations across species.

Taxon Vertebrates, Invertebrates, Plants        Location North America        Methods We incorporate published datasets, from papers that match relevant keywords, to examine taxa around the Cochise Filter Barrier, separating the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts of North America, to synthesize phylogeographic structuring across the communities with respect to organismal functional traits. We then use simulation and machine learning to assess the power of phylogeographic model selection.        Results Taxa distributed across the Cochise Filter Barrier show heterogeneous responses to the barrier in levels of gene flow, phylogeographic structure, divergence timing, barrier width, and divergence mechanism. These responses correlate with locomotor and thermoregulatory traits. Many taxa show a Pleistocene population genetic break, often with introgression after divergence. Allopatric isolation and isolation by environment are the primary mechanisms structuring genetic divergence within taxa. Simulations reveal that in spatially explicit isolation with migration models across the barrier, age of divergence, presence of gene flow, and presence of isolation by distance can confound the interpretation of evolutionary history and model selection by producing easily confusable results. We re-analyze five empirical genetic datasets to illustrate the utility of these simulations despite these constraints.        Main Conclusions By synthesizing phylogeographic data for the Cochise Filter Barrier, we show that barriers interact with species traits to differentiate taxa in communities over millions of years.

For a community, common approaches include fitting individual SDMs (iSDMs) to all taxa or directly modelling community properties such as richness. However, the parameters of iSDMs are difficult to identify for rare taxa, and community properties do not reveal taxon-specific responses. Individual models can be combined into a hierarchical multispecies distribution model (mSDM) that constrains taxon-specific parameters according to overarching community parameters, or a joint model (jSDM) in which interdependencies between taxa are jointly inferred. We compare how individual, hierarchical multispecies and joint SDMs differ in quality of fit, explanatory power and predictive performance, and analyse how these properties depend on the prevalence of taxa. Taxa Presence-absence observations of 245 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa identified at a mixed taxonomic resolution. Location Four hundred and ninety-two sites in rivers throughout Switzerland. Methods Individual, hierarchical and joint hierarchical generalized linear models (GLM) were developed for all taxa. Parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian inference with Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. Predictive performance was assessed with cross-validation. In addition, the predicted family and species richness of the models was compared with a GLM for richness. Results Individual models show a slightly higher quality of fit largely due to overfitting for rare taxa. The mSDM achieves a similar quality of fit and explanatory power, mitigates overfitting for rare taxa and considerably improves predictive performance over the whole community. The joint models further improve the quality of fit, but decrease predictive performance and increase predictive uncertainty.

Therefore, reliable interpretation of the results from different methods depends on the efficacy and reliability of different statistical methods. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of multiple analytical methods to detect the presence of a linear barrier dividing populations. We were specifically interested in determining if simulation conditions, such as dispersal ability and genetic equilibrium, affect the power of different analytical methods for detecting barriers. We evaluated two boundary detection methods (Monmoniers algorithm and WOMBLING), two spatial Bayesian clustering methods (TESS and GENELAND), an aspatial clustering approach (STRUCTURE), and two recently developed, non-Bayesian clustering methods [PSMIX and discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC)]. We found that clustering methods had higher success rates than boundary detection methods and also detected the barrier more quickly. All methods detected the barrier more quickly when dispersal was long distance in comparison to short-distance dispersal scenarios. Bayesian clustering methods performed best overall, both in terms of highest success rates and lowest time to barrier detection, with GENELAND showing the highest power. None of the methods suggested a continuous linear barrier when the data were generated under an isolation-by-distance (IBD) model. However, the clustering methods had higher potential for leading to incorrect barrier inferences under IBD unless strict criteria for successful barrier detection were implemented. Based on our findings and those of previous simulation studies, we discuss the utility of different methods for detecting linear barriers to gene flow.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  112     Total Times Cited:  114     Cited Reference Count:  66,10.1111/j.1755-0998.2012.03151.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bayesian;boundary detection;CDPOP;fragmentation;genetic clustering;individual-based simulations;POPULATION-STRUCTURE;LANDSCAPE GENETICS;SPATIAL STRUCTURE;R-PACKAGE;INFERENCE;DISPERSAL;SURFACES;CLUSTERS;DECLINE;MODELS,,

In landscape genetics, ordination methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) have been used to detect adaptive variation based on genomic data. Taking advantage of environmental data in addition to genotype data, redundancy analysis (RDA) is another ordination approach that is useful to detect adaptive variation. This study aims at proposing a test statistic based on RDA to search for loci under selection. We compare redundancy analysis to pcadapt, which is a nonconstrained ordination method, and to a latent factor mixed model (LFMM), which is a univariate genotype-environment association method. Individual-based simulations identify evolutionary scenarios where RDA genome scans have a greater statistical power than genome scans based on PCA. By constraining the analysis with environmental variables, RDA performs better than PCA in identifying adaptive variation when selection gradients are weakly correlated with population structure. In addition, we show that if RDA and LFMM have a similar power to identify genetic markers associated with environmental variables, the RDA-based procedure has the advantage to identify the main selective gradients as a combination of environmental variables. To give a concrete illustration of RDA in population genomics, we apply this method to the detection of outliers and selective gradients on an SNP data set of Populus trichocarpa (Geraldes et al., ).

However, most studies of biodiversity are limited by uneven sampling effort, with some regions or taxa better sampled than others. Numerous methods have been developed to account for differences in sampling effort, but most methods were developed for systematic surveys in which all study units are sampled using the same design and assemblages are sampled randomly. Databases compiled from multiple sources, such as from the literature, often violate these assumptions because they are composed of studies that vary widely in their goals and methods. Here, we compared the performance of several popular methods for estimating parasite diversity based on a large and widely used parasite database, the Global Mammal Parasite Database (GMPD). We created artificial datasets of host-parasite interactions based on the structure of the GMPD, then used these datasets to evaluate which methods best control for differential sampling effort. We evaluated the precision and bias of seven methods, including species accumulation and nonparametric diversity estimators, compared to analyzing the raw data without controlling for sampling variation. We find that nonparametric estimators, and particularly the Chao2 and second-order jackknife estimators, perform better than other methods. However, these estimators still perform poorly relative to systematic sampling, and effect sizes should be interpreted with caution because they tend to be lower than actual effect sizes. Overall, these estimators are more effective in comparative studies than for producing true estimates of diversity.

GEA methods based on mixed models, such as linear latent factor mixed models (LFMM) and LFMM2, have grown in popularity for their robust performance in terms of power and computational speed. However, it is unclear how the assumption of a Gaussian distribution for the response variables influences model performance. In this paper, we develop a generalized linear model (GLM) that allows for non-Gaussian distribution in the genotypic response variables, and treatment of multiallelic nucleotide polymorphisms. Moreover, this multinomial logistic regression model (MLR) is combined with an admixture-based model or principal components analysis to correct for population structure (MLR-ADM and MLR-PC). Using simulations, we evaluate the type 1 error, false discovery rates (FDR), and power to detect selected SNPs, to guide model choice and best practices. With genomic control, MLR-PC and LFMM2 have similar type 1 error, FDRs, and power when analysing biallelic SNPs, while dramatically outperforming models not accounting for population structure. Differences in performance occur under continuous population structure where MLR-PC outperforms LFMM/LFMM2, especially when a larger number of clusters or triallelic SNPs are analysed. The Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) data set shows that both MLR-PC and LFMM2 control the inflation of P-values. Analysis of the 1,000 Genome Project Phase 3 data set illustrates that MLR-PC and LFMM2 produce consistent results for most significant SNPs, while MLR-PC discovered additional SNPs corresponding to certain genes, suggesting MLR-PC may be a useful alternative to GEA inference.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  52,10.1111/1755-0998.13298,"admixture&#8208;based model;gene&#8208;environmental association;latent factor mixed model;local adaptation;population structure;principal component analysis;Nonlinear Dynamics;Linear Models;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",,

Yet little is known of natural variability in root distribution since collecting field data is challenging and labor-intensive. Studying stable water isotope compositions in plants could offer a cost-effective and practical solution to estimate the absorbing root surfaces distribution. However, such an approach requires developing realistic inverse modeling techniques that enable robust estimation of rooting distributions and associated uncertainty from xylem water isotopic composition observations. This study introduces an inverse modeling method that supports the assessment of the root allocation parameter (beta) that defines the exponential vertical decay of a plants' absorbing root surfaces distribution with soil depth. The method requires measurements obtained from xylem and soil water isotope composition, soil water potentials, and sap flow velocities when plants' xylem water is sampled at a certain height above the rooting point. In a simulation study, we show that the approach can provide unbiased estimates of beta and its associated uncertainty due to measuring errors and unmeasured environmental factors that can impact the xylem water isotopic data. We also recommend improving the accuracy and power of beta estimation, highlighting the need for considering accurate soil water potential and sap flow monitoring. Finally, we apply the inverse modeling method to xylem water isotope data of lianas and trees collected in French Guiana. Our work shows that the inverse modeling procedure provides a robust analytical and statistical framework to estimate beta. The method accounts for potential bias due to extraction errors and unmeasured environmental factors, which improves the viability of using stable water isotope compositions to estimate the distribution of absorbing root surfaces complementary to the assessment of relative root water uptake profiles.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  77,10.3389/ffgc.2021.689335     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),absorbing root surfaces distribution;ecohydrology;lianas;stable water isotopes;tropical trees;water competition;STABLE-ISOTOPES;SOIL-WATER;OSMOTIC PROPERTIES;VACUUM EXTRACTION;GLOBAL PATTERNS;CANOPY TREES;LIANA;HYDROGEN;PERSPECTIVES;EQUATIONS,,

Location French Alps.        Methods Our approach gradually constrains null models by: (1) filtering out species not able to survive in the regional conditions in order to reduce the spatial scale, and (2) shuffling species only within lineages of different ages to reduce the evolutionary scale of the analysis. We first tested and validated this approach using simulated communities. We then applied it to study the functional diversity patterns of the leaf-height-seed strategy of plant communities in the French Alps.        Results Using simulations, we found that reducing the spatial scale correctly detected a signature of competition (functional divergence) even when environmental filtering produced an overlaying signal of functional convergence. However, constraining the evolutionary scale did not change the identified functional diversity patterns. In the case study of alpine plant communities, investigating scale effects revealed that environmental filtering had a strong influence at larger spatial and evolutionary scales and that neutral processes were more important at smaller scales. In contrast to the simulation study results, decreasing the evolutionary scale tended to increase patterns of functional divergence.

Global positioning system data from animals allow fine-scale assessments of habitat selection and typically are analyzed in a use-availability framework, whereby animal locations are contrasted with random locations (the availability sample). Although most use-availability methods are in fact spatial point process models, they often are fit using logistic regression. This framework offers numerous methodological challenges, for which the literature provides little guidance. Specifically, the size and spatial extent of the availability sample influences coefficient estimates potentially causing interpretational bias. We examined the influence of availability on statistical inference through simulations and analysis of serially correlated mule deer GPS data. Bias in estimates arose from incorrectly assessing and sampling the spatial extent of availability. Spatial autocorrelation in covariates, which is common for landscape characteristics, exacerbated the error in availability sampling leading to increased bias. These results have strong implications for habitat selection analyses using GPS data, which are increasingly prevalent in the literature.

Capturerecapture mixture models are important tools in evolution and ecology to estimate demographic parameters and abundance while accounting for individual heterogeneity. A key step is to select the correct number of mixture components i) to provide unbiased estimates that can be used as reliable proxies of fitness or ingredients in management strategies and ii) classify individuals into biologically meaningful classes. However, there is no consensus method in the statistical literature for selecting the number of components. 2. In ecology, most studies rely on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) that has recently gained attention in ecology. The Integrated Completed Likelihood criterion (ICL; IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2000, 22, 719) was specifically developed to favour well-separated components, but its use has never been investigated in ecology. 3. We compared the performance of AIC, BIC and ICL for selecting the number of components with regard to a) bias and accuracy of survival and detection estimates and b) success in selecting the true number of components using extensive simulations and data on wolf (Canis lupus) that were used for management through survival and abundance estimation. 4. Bias in survival and detection estimates was <0.02 for both AIC and BIC, and more than 0.09 for ICL, while mean square error was <0.05 for all criteria. As expected, bias increased as heterogeneity increased. Success rates of AIC and BIC in selecting the true number of components were better than ICL (68% for AIC, 58% for BIC, and 16% for ICL). As the degree of heterogeneity increased, AIC (and BIC in a lesser extent) overestimated the number of components, while ICL often underestimated this number. For the wolf study, the 2-class model was selected by BIC and ICL, while AIC could not decide between the 2- and 3-class models. 5. We recommend using AIC or BIC when the aim is to estimate parameters.

This assumption is rarely met when SDM practitioners rely on federated museum records from natural history collections for geo-located occurrences due to inherent sampling bias found in these collections. We use a simulation approach to explore the effectiveness of three methods developed to account for sampling bias in SDM with PB frameworks. Two of the methods rely on careful filtering of observation data-geographic thinning (G-Filter) and environmental thinning (E-Filter)-while a third, FactorBiasOut, creates selection weights for background data to bias locations toward areas where the observation dataset was sampled. While these methods have been assessed previously, evaluation has emphasized spatial predictions of habitat potential. Here, we dig deeper into the effectiveness of these methods by exploring how sampling bias not only affects predictions of habitat potential, but also our understanding of niche characteristics such as which explanatory variables and response curves best represent species-environment relationships. We simulate 100 virtual species ranging from generalist to specialist in their habitat preferences and introduce geographic and environmental bias at three intensity levels to measure the effectiveness of each correction method to (1) predict true probability of occurrence across a study area, (2) recover true species-environment relationships, and (3) identify true explanatory variables. We find that the FactorBiasOut most often showed the greatest improvement in recreating known distributions but did no better at correctly identifying environmental covariates or recreating species-environment relationships than G-Filter or E-Filter methods. Narrow niche species are most problematic for biased calibration datasets, such that correction methods can, in some cases, make predictions worse.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  109,10.1002/ecs2.3422     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),background weights;environmental space;FactorBiasOut;geographic space;MaxEnt;sampling bias;spatial filtering;spatial thinning;species distribution modeling;virtual species;PRESENCE-ONLY DATA;ECOLOGICAL NICHE;CLIMATE-CHANGE;ENVIRONMENTAL NICHE;CONSERVATION;PERFORMANCE;PREDICTION;ACCURACY;IMPROVE;SIZE;Selection Bias;Bias (Epidemiology),,

Measuring plant abundance by visually assessing percent cover and recording a cover class is a common field method that yields ordinal data. Statistical models for ordinal data exist but entail cumbersome interpretations and sometimes restrictive assumptions. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical framework for analysing cover class data that allows for linking ordinal observations to a latent beta distribution and accounts for zero inflation. Harnessing a latent beta distribution supports interpreting changes in abundance in terms of mean percent cover rather than odds ratios of cumulative cover classes as for cumulative link models. The zero augmentation allows for simultaneous inferences on both occurrence (distribution) and abundance. We show how our model can account for true and false zeros, misclassification of cover classes, multiple species and hierarchical sampling designs, using empirical examples and simulations. Simulated observation errors, when ignored, led to models overestimating abundance and underestimating occurrence. Based on simulations, we found no substantial difference between mean percent cover estimates when analyzing ordinal cover classes versus continuous percent cover as the response. Our empirical datasets displayed high probability of detection (>0.85 on average for all species), likely due to the sampling design used and training of observers. Probability of occurrence was slightly underestimated for bare ground, Artemisia tridentata, Elycap medusae, and Poa secunda using a model that ignored imperfect detection. Estimated mean percent cover was not substantially impacted by ignoring measurement error for five plant species and bare ground. Our modelling framework for cover class data allows for an explicit separation of distribution from abundance and, importantly, allows for interpreting species-environment relationships in terms of variation in mean percent cover as compared to cumulative odds ratios. The beta distribution inherently accommodates heteroscedasticity and skewness, statistical properties that are a consequence of spatially aggregated patterns common to plant survey data. Recording cover classes provides a reliable, efficient way to measure plants and our simulations suggest little loss of information compared to assuming continuous percent cover.

However, applying those advances to real data remains a challenge. Ecologists often end up describing their samples rather than estimating the diversity components of an underlying study system, and existing approaches do not easily provide statistical frameworks for testing ecological questions. Here we offer one avenue to do all of the above using a hierarchical Bayesian approach. We estimate posterior distributions of the underlying true relative abundances of each species within each unit sampled. These posterior estimates of relative abundance can then be used with existing formulae to estimate and partition diversity. The result is a posterior distribution of diversity metrics describing our knowledge (or beliefs) about the study system. This approach intuitively leads to statistical inferences addressing biologically motivated hypotheses via Bayesian model comparison. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our approach does as well or better at approximating the true diversity of a community relative to naive or ad-hoc bias-corrected estimates. Moreover, model comparison correctly distinguishes between alternative hypotheses about the distribution of diversity within and among samples. Finally, we use an empirical ecological dataset to illustrate how the approach can be used to address questions about the makeup and diversities of assemblages at local and regional scales.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.1002/ecy.2174     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),community composition;differentiation;effective diversity;estimation;finite sampling;Hill numbers;Markov chain Monte Carlo;overlap;statistical comparison;turnover;BETA-DIVERSITY;NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION;SPECIES-DIVERSITY;SPATIAL STRUCTURE;DISCOVERY RATES;ENTROPY;ESTIMATOR;DISSIMILARITY;BIODIVERSITY;GRADIENTS,,

Complementary to this need for diverse approaches is the recent focus on integrated modeling in statistical ecology. Population-level processes represent the core of spatial capture-recapture (SCR), with many methodological extensions that have been motivated by standing ecological theory and data-integration opportunities. The extent to which these recent advances offer inferential improvements can be limited by the data requirements for quantifying individual-level processes. This is especially true for SCR models that use non-Euclidean distance to relax the restrictive assumption that individual space use is stationary and symmetrical to make inferences about landscape connectivity. To meet the challenges of scale and data quality, we propose integrating an explicit movement model with non-Euclidean SCR for joint estimation of a shared cost parameter between individual and population processes. Here, we define a movement kernel for step selection that uses ""ecological distance"" instead of Euclidean distance to quantify availability for each movement step in terms of landscape cost. We compare performance of our integrated model to that of existing SCR models using realistic animal movement simulations and data collected on black bears. We demonstrate that an integrated approach offers improvements both in terms of bias and precision in estimating the shared cost parameter over models fit to spatial encounters alone. Simulations suggest these gains were only realized when step lengths were small relative to home range size, and estimates of density were insensitive to whether or not an integrated approach was used. By combining the fine spatiotemporal scale of individual movement processes with the estimation of population density in SCR, integrated approaches such as the one we develop here have the potential to unify the fields of movement, population, and landscape ecology and improve our understanding of landscape connectivity.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  47,10.1002/ecy.3544,animal movement;connectivity;cost function;data integration;spatial capture-recapture;Special Feature;Linking Capture-Recapture and Movement;RESOURCE SELECTION;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;CIRCUIT-THEORY;HOME-RANGE;POPULATION;FRAGMENTATION;DYNAMICS;ECOLOGY;Movement,,

These models have been used on count data for single species that can be identified with certainty. However, co-occurring species often look similar during one or more life stages, making it difficult to assign species for all recorded captures. This uncertainty creates problems for estimating species-specific abundance, and it can often limit life stages to which we can make inference. We present a new extension of N-mixture models that accounts for species uncertainty. In addition to estimating site-specific abundances and detection probabilities, this model allows estimating probability of correct assignment of species identity. We implement this hierarchical model in a Bayesian framework and provide all code for running the model in BUGS language programs. We present an application of the model on count data from two sympatric freshwater fishes, the brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans) and the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), and illustrate implementation of covariate effects (habitat characteristics). In addition, we used a simulation study to validate the model and illustrate potential sample size issues. We also compared, for both real and simulated data, estimates provided by our model to those obtained by a simple N-mixture model when captures of unknown species identification were discarded. In the latter case, abundance estimates appeared highly biased and very imprecise, while our new model provided unbiased estimates with higher precision. This extension of the N-mixture model should be useful for a wide variety of studies and taxa, as species uncertainty is a common issue. It should notably help improve investigation of abundance and vital rate characteristics of organisms' early life stages, which are sometimes more difficult to identify than adults.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  39,10.1111/2041-210X.12570     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Culaea inconstans;N-mixture models;population size estimation;Pseudacris maculata;Pungitius pungitius;Rana sylvatica;species uncertainty;N-MIXTURE MODELS;REPLICATED COUNTS;POPULATIONS;DETECTIONS;SELECTION;DYNAMICS;BEHAVIOR;RARE,,

Nearly all previous estimators of the RAD use the conventional `` plug-in'' estimator (p) over cap (i) (sample relative abundance) of the true relative abundance p(i) of species i. Because most biodiversity samples are incomplete, the plug-in estimators are applied only to the subset of species that are detected in the sample. Using the concept of sample coverage and its generalization, we propose a new statistical framework to estimate the complete RAD by separately adjusting the sample relative abundances for the set of species detected in the sample and estimating the relative abundances for the set of species undetected in the sample but inferred to be present in the assemblage. We first show that (p) over cap (i) is a positively biased estimator of pi for species detected in the sample, and that the degree of bias increases with increasing relative rarity of each species. We next derive a method to adjust the sample relative abundance to reduce the positive bias inherent in (p) over cap (i). The adjustment method provides a nonparametric resolution to the longstanding challenge of characterizing the relationship between the true relative abundance in the entire assemblage and the observed relative abundance in a sample. Finally, we propose a method to estimate the true relative abundances of the undetected species based on a lower bound of the number of undetected species. We then combine the adjusted RAD for the detected species and the estimated RAD for the undetected species to obtain the complete RAD estimator. Simulation results show that the proposed RAD curve can unveil the true RAD and is more accurate than the empirical RAD. We also extend our method to incidence data. Our formulas and estimators are illustrated using empirical data sets from surveys of forest spiders (for abundance data) and soil ciliates (for incidence data). The proposed RAD estimator is also applicable to estimating various diversity measures and should be widely useful to analyses of biodiversity and community structure.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  53     Total Times Cited:  57     Cited Reference Count:  34,10.1890/14-0550.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Good-Turing theory;relative abundance;sample coverage;species abundance distribution (SAD);species-rank abundance distribution (RAD);COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;RELATIVE ABUNDANCE;POPULATION;EXTRAPOLATION;RAREFACTION;DIVERSITY;ASSEMBLAGES;FRAMEWORK;PATTERNS;MODELS,,

With this method, only the presence or absence of the target species is recorded on plots and thus the method is straightforward to apply and less prone to surveyor judgement compared to other vegetation monitoring methods. However, in the basic setting, all plots must be equally large or otherwise it is unclear how data should be analysed. In this study, we propose and evaluate five different methods for estimating plant density based on presence-absence registrations from surveys with variable plot sizes.        Using artificial plant population data as well as empirical data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory, we evaluated the performance of the proposed methods. The main analysis was conducted through sampling simulation in artificial populations, whereby bias and variance of density estimators for the different methods were quantified and compared.        Both for state and change estimation of plant density, we found that the best method to handle variable plot size was to perform generalized least squares regression, using plot size as an independent variable. Methods where plots smaller than a certain threshold were excluded or their registrations recalculated were, however, almost as good. Using all registrations as if they were obtained from plots with the nominal plot size resulted in substantial bias.        Our findings are important for plant population studies in a wide range of environmental monitoring programmes. In these programmes, plots are typically randomly laid out and may be located across boundaries between different land-use or land-cover classes, resulting in subplots of variable size. Such splitting of plots is common when large plots are used, for example, with the 100 m(2) plots used in the Swedish National Forest Inventory.

Knowledge of animal diets can provide important insights into life history and ecology, relationships among species in a community and potential response to ecosystem change or perturbation. Quantitative fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA) is a method of estimating diets from data on the composition, or signature, of fatty acids stored in adipose tissue. Given data on signatures of potential prey, a predator diet is estimated by minimizing the distance between its signature and a mixture of prey signatures. Calibration coefficients, constants derived from feeding trials, are used to account for differential metabolism of individual fatty acids. QFASA has been widely applied since its introduction and several variants of the original estimator have appeared in the literature. However, work to compare the statistical properties of QFASA estimators has been limited.        2. One important characteristic of an estimator is its robustness to violations of model assumptions. The primary assumptions of QFASA are that prey signature data contain representatives of all prey types consumed and the calibration coefficients are known without error. We investigated the robustness of two QFASA estimators to a range of violations of these assumptions using computer simulation and recorded the resulting bias in diet estimates.        3. We found that the Aitchison distance measure was most robust to errors in the calibration coefficients. Conversely, the Kullback-Leibler distance measure was most robust to the consumption of prey without representation in the prey signature data.        4. In most QFASA applications, investigators will generally have some knowledge of the prey available to predators and be able to assess the completeness of prey signature data and sample additional prey as necessary. Conversely, because calibration coefficients are derived from feeding trials with captive animals and their values may be sensitive to consumer physiology and nutritional status, their applicability to free-ranging animals is difficult to establish. We therefore recommend that investigators first make any improvements to the prey signature data that seem warranted and then base estimation on the Aitchison distance measure, as it appears to minimize risk from violations of the assumption that is most difficult to verify.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  26     Cited Reference Count:  16,10.1111/2041-210X.12456     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Aitchison;bias;diet composition;diet estimation;Kullback-Leibler;QFASA;simulation;DIET,,

Here, we develop a practical, multi-stage approach for statistical inference into the behavioural mechanisms underlying how habitat and dynamic energy landscapes-in this case how airflow increases or decreases the energetic efficiency of flight-shape animal home ranges based around central places.

Further, we found that males and females partition their home ranges dynamically based on uplift. Specifically, changes in wind and sun angle drove differential space use between sexes, especially later in the breeding season when energetic demands of growing nestlings require both parents to forage more widely.        This method is easily implemented using widely available programming languages and is based on a hierarchical multistate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck space use process that incorporates habitat and energy landscapes. The underlying mathematical properties of the model allow straightforward computation of predicted utilization distributions, permitting estimation of home range size and visualization of space use patterns under varying conditions.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.1111/2041-210X.13538,Bayesian;biased random walk;continuous time model;empirical Bayes;golden eagle;Markov process;movement model;recursive Bayes;MIGRATORY GOLDEN EAGLES;SPACE-USE PATTERNS;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;HOME-RANGE;TELEMETRY DATA;MODELS;LANDSCAPES;FLIGHT,,

We considered O'Hara and Kotze's (2010) comparisons, and determined that the finding occurred primarily because the quantity that they estimated in their simulations of the linear model analysis (the mean of a transformation of the count data) was not the same quantity that was simulated and to which the results were compared (the logarithm of the mean of the count data). We correct this discrepancy, re-run O'Hara and Kotze's simulations and add additional simple analyses. We found that the apparent superiority of the GLMs over linear models in O'Hara and Kotze's (2010) simulations was primarily an artefact of divergence in the meanings of results from the two analyses. After converting results from linear model analyses of transformed data to estimators of the same quantity as provided by the GLM, results from both analyses rarely differed substantially. Furthermore, under the circumstances considered by O'Hara and Kotze, we find that an even simpler implementation of linear model analysis, inference of the mean of the raw data, performs even better and gives identical results to the GLM.

These assumptions lead to differences in plant size dynamics between these models and spatially explicit models (or observations of real forests). Therefore, to more accurately replicate dynamics, these models require model tuning by (1) adjusting model parameter values or (2) introducing a correction term into models. However, these model tuning methods have not been systematically and statistically investigated in models using different patch sizes.        We used a simple spatially explicit model that simulated growth and competition processes, and rewrote it as patch models. The patch sizes of the patch models were set between 4 and 1500 m(2). First, we estimated the parameter values (the intrinsic growth rate, metabolic loss, competition coefficient, and competitive asymmetry) of these models that best reproduce plant size growth under competition using field data from a Sakhalin fir stand, and compared the parameter values among the models. Second, we introduced correction terms into the patch models and estimated the optimal correction term for reproducing plant size growth under competition using the field data.        The estimated parameter values of the patch models for all patch sizes differed greatly from those of the spatially explicit models. Therefore, parameter values should not be shared between spatially explicit models and patch models. In addition, the parameter value sets for the models with small patches differed from those with large patches. This is because parameter values for small patches mainly improve biases of A-II, while those for large patches mainly improve biases of A-I. Therefore, parameter values should not be shared between patch models with small patches and with large patches.        The estimated correction term in the patch models with large patches excluded the competitive effects of small and medium-sized plants on their neighbors, even though these effects exist in real stands. This exclusion can be ascribed to the discrepancy between their competition in real plant populations and A-I. Therefore, the competitive effects of small and medium-sized plants should not be included in patch models with large patches. Finally, the reproducibility of the models tuned with correction terms was higher than those with adjusted parameters. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although climate is directly important for vegetation composition in the boreal forests, these ecosystems are strongly sensitive to an indirect effect of climate via fire disturbance. However, the driving balance of fire disturbance and climate on composition is poorly understood. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed their individual contributions for the boreal forests of the Heilongjiang Province, China, and their response to climate change using four warming scenarios (+1.5 degrees, 2 degrees, 3 degrees, and 4 degrees C). This study employs the statistical methods of Redundancy Analysis (RDA) and variation partitioning combined with simulation results from a SErgey VERsion Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SEVER-DGVM), and remote sensing datasets of global land cover (GLC2000) and the third version of Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED3). Results show that the vegetation distribution for the present day is mainly determined directly by climate (35%) rather than fire (1-10.9%). However, with a future global warming of 1.5 degrees C, local vegetation composition will be determined by fires rather than climate (36.3% > 29.3%). Above 1.5 degrees C warming, temperature will be more important than fires in regulating vegetation distribution although other factors such as precipitation can also contribute. The spatial pattern in vegetation composition over the region, as evaluated by Moran's Eigenvector Map (MEM), has a significant impact on local vegetation coverage; for example, composition at any individual location is highly related to that in its neighborhood. It represents the largest contribution to vegetation distribution in all scenarios, but will not change the driving balance between climate and fires.

To estimate N-S, we describe, evaluate and apply two nonparametric species richness estimators to information associated with genetic pedigree reconstruction. Simulations compared bias and precision associated with Chao and Jackknife methods when estimating N-S. We also evaluated N-S estimation sensitivity to two sources of variation associated with species reproductive ecology (variance in reproductive success and sex ratio skew) and genetic pedigree assignment error. Finally, the application of our novel method was demonstrated in two different species and systems (Chinook Salmon in Oregon, USA and Lake Sturgeon in Michigan, USA). We found unbiased N-S estimates were generated across a broad range of offspring sample sizes using the Chao method. Empirical results corroborated simulation-based expectations and highlighted applications where parents and offspring are sampled, and when only offspring are sampled.

Despite its utility for evolutionary ecologists, this method is subject to the classical assumptions of multiple regressions, which could result in potential analytical problems. In particular, spatial autocorrelation in fitness violates the assumption of residuals independence. Although widespread in the wild, the consequences of this effect have yet to be investigated in the context of Lande and Arnold's regression and resulting selection estimation.        2. Here we first described four spatially explicit models that allow to control for spatial autocorrelation in residuals of the Lande and Arnold's regression: a generalized least square (GLS) model with a distance-based exponential covariance function, two simultaneous autoregressive models (SAR, the lagged-response model (SAR-lag) and the spatial error model (SAR-err)) and a 5-step procedure using the principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) method based on the extraction of spatial descriptors. We then compared the four spatially explicit models of selection to non-spatial models for three life-history traits recorded over 6 years in a wild blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) population. We also compared the performance of the four spatially explicit models of selection using a simulation approach.        3. Our analyses revealed strong spatial autocorrelation in residuals of selection models, which was completely described by the two SAR and the PCNM models, while only partially described by the GLS model. The magnitude of selection gradients and differentials decreased systematically in the 4 spatially explicit models while the degree of fit of these models increased (except for the GLS model). Moreover, we showed using simulations that the selection coefficients extracted from the SAR-lag model were systematically biased compared to those extracted from the GLS, SAR-err and PCNM models.        4. We hereby showed that spatial autocorrelation in fitness can severely affect selection differentials and gradients, even at a relatively small spatial scale. By using geostatistical models such as PCNM or SAR-err models, it is possible to control for this spatial autocorrelation. Finally, since spatial autocorrelation is closely linked to spatial environmental variation, this approach can also be used to explore environmental components of covariance between fitness and traits.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  52,10.1111/2041-210X.12448     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"blue tit;multiple regression;pseudoreplication;selection gradients;spatial autocorrelation;spatial heterogeneity;STATISTICAL-INFERENCE;PHENOTYPIC SELECTION;REGRESSION-ANALYSIS;GENETIC-VARIATION;RED HERRINGS;EVOLUTION;HERITABILITY;POPULATION;PATTERNS;TRAITS;Selection, Genetic",,

When models are developed using data from such programs, a key question is whether or not to utilize design information when analyzing the relationship between a response variable and a set of covariates. Standard statistical regression methods often fail to account for complex sampling designs, which may lead to severely biased estimators of model coefficients. Furthermore, ignoring that data are spatially correlated within clusters may underestimate the standard errors of regression coefficient estimates, with a risk for drawing wrong conclusions. We first review general approaches that account for complex sampling designs, e.g. methods using probability weighting, and stress the need to explore the effects of the sampling design when applying logistic regression models. We then use Monte Carlo simulation to compare the performance of the standard logistic regression model with two approaches to model correlated binary responses, i.e. cluster-specific and population-averaged logistic regression models. As an example, we analyze the occurrence of epiphytic hair lichens in the genus Bryoria; an indicator of forest ecosystem integrity. Based on data from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) for the period 1993-2014 we generated a data set on hair lichen occurrence on > 100,000 Picea abies trees distributed throughout Sweden. The NFI data included ten covariates representing forest structure and climate variables potentially affecting lichen occurrence. Our analyses show the importance of taking complex sampling designs and correlated binary responses into account in logistic regression modeling to avoid the risk of obtaining notably biased parameter estimators and standard errors, and erroneous interpretations about factors affecting e.g. hair lichen occurrence.

However, bias due to a behavioural response to capture in the presence of missing data has only recently been recognized and no statistical methodology exists to accommodate it. In a hair snare mark-recapture experiment, data can be missing if animals encounter a hair snare without leaving a hair sample, poor-quality samples are not genotyped, a fraction of all samples collected are genotyped due to cost considerations (subsampling) and/or not all genotyped hair samples provide an individual identification. These are all common features of hair snare mark-recapture experiments. Here, we present methodology that accounts for a behavioural response to capture in the presence of missing data from (i) subsampling and (ii) failure of hair samples to produce an individual identification. Four subprocesses are modelled-animal capture, hair deposition, researcher subsampling and DNA amplification with key parameters estimated from functions of the number of hair samples left by individuals at traps. We assess the properties of this methodology (bias and interval coverage) via simulation and then apply this methodology to a previously published data set. Our methodology removes bias and provides nominal interval coverage of population size for the simulation scenarios considered. In the example data set, we find that removing 75% of the hair samples leads to a 40% lower estimate of population size. Our methodology corrects about half of this bias and we identify a second source of bias that has not previously been reported associated with differential trap visitation rates among individuals within trapping occasions. Our methodology will allow researchers to reliably estimate the size of a closed population in the presence of a behavioural response to capture and missing data for a subset of missing data scenarios. It also provides a framework for understanding this generally unrecognized problem and for further extension to handle other missing data scenarios.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  17     Cited Reference Count:  31,10.1111/2041-210X.12289     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioural response;closed population;DNA;hair snare;mark-recapture;missing data;MARK-RECAPTURE;GRIZZLY BEARS;GENETIC DATA;BLACK BEARS;DENSITY;MODELS;ABUNDANCE;QUALITY;Population Density,,

Ecologists and many evolutionary biologists relate the variation in physiological, behavioural, life-history, demographic, population and community traits to the variation in weather, a key environmental driver. However, identifying which weather variables (e.g. rain, temperature, El Nino index), over which time period (e.g. recent weather, spring or year-round weather) and in what ways (e.g. mean, threshold of temperature) they affect biological responses is by no means trivial, particularly when traits are expressed at different times among individuals.        2. A literature review shows that a systematic approach for identifying weather signals is lacking and that the majority of studies select weather variables from a small number of competing hypotheses that are founded on unverified a priori assumptions. This is worrying because studies that investigate the nature of weather signals in detail suggest that signals can be complex. Using suboptimal or wrongly identified weather signals may lead to unreliable projections and management decisions.        3. We propose a four-step approach that allows for more rigorous identification and quantification of weather signals (or any other predictor variable for which data are available at high temporal resolution), easily implementable with our new R package 'climwin'. We compare our approach with conventional approaches and provide worked examples.        4.

Estimated spawner-biomass depletion was compared to the 'true' simulated population to quantify method-specific accuracy and bias using root-mean-squared error. Due to higher data variability and inherent size selectivity of angling, stereo-BRUVs provided more accurate spawner-biomass trends when describing a distinct population decline over 10 and 20 years. Additionally, spawner-biomass was found to be a more accurate population estimate than relative abundance indices due to the inclusion of population size structure information. The study demonstrates the potential of using simulation testing to evaluate sampling methods, given that the process generates the 'true' population with a known abundance and size structure.

The accuracy of climate data is pivotal to the estimation of net primary productivity (NPP). Unrealistic simulations of climate data without considering the topography would lead to biased estimation of NPP. In this work, we aim to evaluate quantitatively the NPP difference with and without considering the topographical effects of climate data, and furthermore, to explore the spatio-temporal characteristics of NPP difference and the primary contributing variables to the difference. For these purposes, two different climate datasets were first built and compared with the station observations, one of which considered topographical effects (terrain-based climate dataset) while the other one did not (ordinary climate dataset). We quantified topographical effects of climate data on NPP estimation by inputting two different climate datasets to the same ecosystem model, the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS), to evaluate the importance of considering topography during NPP calculations. Then, spatio-temporal characteristics of the NPP difference were explored, and the primary contributing variables were determined through a series of simulation experiments. Results showed that, on average, ordinary climate dataset underestimated NPP by 12.5% compared with terrain-based climate dataset over the whole Wuling mountainous area. Topographical effects of climate data had larger impacts on the NPP estimation in summer time than in winter months. In space, differences between ordinary NPP and terrain-based NPP were negligible below 200 m, and above 200 m, the differences increased first and then steadily decreased; discrepancies between NPPs continually augmented with the slope increasing; and NPP was more likely to be affected in the north and northwest than in the south and southeast The primary climate variables contributing to the NPP difference in Wuling mountainous area were temperatures, followed by global solar radiation. The research methods developed in this case study can also be applied to other study areas and other ecosystem models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Distance sampling is a common survey method in wildlife studies, because it allows accounting for imperfect detection. The framework has been extended to hierarchical distance sampling (HDS), which accommodates the modelling of abundance as a function of covariates, but rare and elusive species may not yield enough observations to fit such a model.        2. We integrate HDS into a community modelling framework that accommodates multi-species spatially replicated distance sampling data. The model allows species-specific parameters, but these come from a common underlying distribution. This form of information sharing enables estimation of parameters for species with sparse data sets that would otherwise be discarded from analysis. We evaluate the performance of the model under varying community sizes with different species-specific abundances through a simulation study. We further fit the model to a seabird data set obtained from shipboard distance sampling surveys off the East Coast of the USA.        3. Comparing communities comprised of 5, 15 or 30 species, bias of all community-level parameters and some species-level parameters decreased with increasing community size, while precision increased. Most species-level parameters were less biased for more abundant species. For larger communities, the community model increased precision in abundance estimates of rarely observed species when compared to single-species models. For the seabird application, we found a strong negative association of community and species abundance with distance to shore. Water temperature and prey density had weak effects on seabird abundance. Patterns in overall abundance were consistent with known seabird ecology.        4. The community distance sampling model can be expanded to account for imperfect availability, imperfect species identification or other missing individual covariates. The model allowed us to make inference about ecology of species communities, including rarely observed species, which is particularly important in conservation and management. The approach holds great potential to improve inference on species communities that can be surveyed with distance sampling.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  32     Total Times Cited:  36     Cited Reference Count:  42,10.1111/2041-210X.12518     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bayesian P-value;cluster size;hierarchical model;seabirds;sparse data;wildlife surveys;COUNT DATA;RICHNESS;SEABIRDS;DENSITY;BIAS,,

While many methods exist to estimate abundance from individually identifiable animals, it is much more difficult to estimate abundance of unmarked animals. One step toward noninvasive abundance estimation is the use of passive detectors such as remote cameras or acoustic recording devices. However, existing methods for estimating abundance from cameras for unmarked animals are limited by variable detection probability and have not taken full advantage of the information in camera trapping rate. We developed a time to event (TTE) model to estimate abundance from trapping rate. This estimate requires independent estimates of animal movement, so we collapsed the sampling occasions to create a space to event (STE) model that is not sensitive to movement rate. We further simplified the STE model into an instantaneous sampling (IS) estimator that applies fixed-area counts to cameras. The STE and IS models utilize time-lapse photographs to eliminate the variability in detection probability that comes with motion-sensor photographs. We evaluated the three methods with simulations and performed a case study to estimate elk (Cervus canadensis) abundance from remote camera trap data in Idaho. Simulations demonstrated that the TTE model is sensitive to movement rate, but the STE and IS methods are unbiased regardless of movement. In our case study, elk abundance estimates were comparable to those from a recent aerial survey in the area, demonstrating that these new methods allow biologists to estimate abundance from unmarked populations without tracking individuals over time.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  51     Total Times Cited:  54     Cited Reference Count:  51,10.1002/ecs2.2331     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),abundance;Cervus canadensis;density;elk;exponential distribution;Poisson point process;remote camera;space to event;time-lapse photography;time to event;unmarked population;N-MIXTURE MODELS;PHOTOGRAPHIC RATES;ESTIMATE DENSITIES;CRYPTIC MAMMALS;VISIBILITY BIAS;TRAPS;POPULATIONS;ENCOUNTER;SURVIVAL;SIGNALS;Animal Shells;Animals,,

To relate community patterns to particular factors defining habitat conditions, ecologists often use canonical ordinations such as canonical redundancy analysis (RDA). It is a common practice to use dissimilarity coefficients to perform canonical ordinations through distance-based RDA (db-RDA) or transformation-based RDA (tb-RDA). Dissimilarity coefficients are measures of resemblance where the information about species communities is condensed into a symmetric square matrix of dissimilarities among sites. In this study, we compared 16 of the most commonly used dissimilarity coefficients to evaluate if the species-abundance distribution (SAD) of a community can be used to select an appropriate coefficient. Of these, 11 are designed to be used primarily with abundance data, although they can also be used with presence-absence data, whereas five can only be applied to presence-absence data. Using simulations, we compared the explained variance of RDAs differing only by their coefficients to evaluate how the abundance patterns of communities influence coefficient choice. We found that coefficients are largely equivalent, independently of the community SAD. In light of these findings, we propose the consensus RDA method, a new canonical ordination procedure that performs a consensus of RDAs across several coefficients. This new method focuses on the common relations found by independent RDAs differing only by their dissimilarity coefficients; this ensures the absence of a coefficient-related bias when interpreting the canonical ordination result. Also, because in our simulations the presence-absence data were directly derived from the abundance data, we were able to evaluate if the information in presence-absence data was equivalent to that in abundance data. We found that although some information was lost by converting abundance data into presence-absence, both data formats may be complementary. When applying consensus RDA to abundance and presence-absence data independently, a more complete understanding and interpretation of the ecological patterns is obtained. An ecological example illustrating consensus RDA and the conclusions of our simulations is presented, using Carabidae data collected at the Ecosystem Management Emulating Natural Disturbances (EMEND) project in northwestern Alberta, Canada.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  68,10.1890/13-0648.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),abundance data;canonical redundancy analysis (RDA);Carabidae;dissimilarity coefficient;presence-absence data;species-abundance distribution (SAD);species-presence distribution (SPD);SPATIAL STRUCTURE;BETA DIVERSITY;ECOLOGICAL DATA;CLASSIFICATION;ASSEMBLAGES;DESIGN;MODEL,,

While advances in animal tracking technology have increased our capacity to collect data to support home range analysis, these same advances have also resulted in increasingly autocorrelated data. Consequently, the question of which home range estimator to use on modern, highly autocorrelated tracking data remains open. This question is particularly relevant given that most estimators assume independently sampled data. Here, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of autocorrelation on home range estimation. We base our study on an extensive data set of GPS locations from 369 individuals representing 27 species distributed across five continents. We first assemble a broad array of home range estimators, including Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) with four bandwidth optimizers (Gaussian reference function, autocorrelated-Gaussian reference function [AKDE], Silverman's rule of thumb, and least squares cross-validation), Minimum Convex Polygon, and Local Convex Hull methods. Notably, all of these estimators except AKDE assume independent and identically distributed (IID) data. We then employ half-sample cross-validation to objectively quantify estimator performance, and the recently introduced effective sample size for home range area estimation ((N) over cap (area)) to quantify the information content of each data set. We found that AKDE 95% area estimates were larger than conventional IID-based estimates by a mean factor of 2. The median number of cross-validated locations included in the hold-out sets by AKDE 95% (or 50%) estimates was 95.3% (or 50.1%), confirming the larger AKDE ranges were appropriately selective at the specified quantile. Conversely, conventional estimates exhibited negative bias that increased with decreasing (N) over cap (area). To contextualize our empirical results, we performed a detailed simulation study to tease apart how sampling frequency, sampling duration, and the focal animal's movement conspire to affect range estimates. Paralleling our empirical results, the simulation study demonstrated that AKDE was generally more accurate than conventional methods, particularly for small (N) over cap (area). While 72% of the 369 empirical data sets had >1,000 total observations, only 4% had an (N) over cap (area) >1,000, where 30% had an (N) over cap (area) <30. In this frequently encountered scenario of small <(N)over cap>(area), AKDE was the only estimator capable of producing an accurate home range estimate on autocorrelated data.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  74     Total Times Cited:  75     Cited Reference Count:  96,10.1002/ecm.1344     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),animal movement;kernel density estimation;local convex hull;minimum convex polygon;range distribution;space use;telemetry;tracking data;GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM;BEHAVIORAL-CHANGES;ANIMAL BEHAVIOR;MOVEMENT DATA;SAMPLE-SIZE;TELEMETRY;DENSITY;TIME;CONSERVATION;SPACE;Bias (Epidemiology),,

In this study, we evaluate multivariate evolution of shell shape in 93 bivalved scallop species, combining geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods. Phylomorphospace visualization described the history of morphological diversification in the group; revealing that taxa with a recessing life habit were the most distinctive in shell shape, and appeared to display a directional trend. To evaluate this hypothesis empirically, we extended existing methods by characterizing the mean directional evolution in phylomorphospace for recessing scallops. We then compared this pattern to what was expected under several alternative evolutionary scenarios using phylogenetic simulations. The observed pattern did not fall within the distribution obtained under multivariate Brownian motion, enabling us to reject this evolutionary scenario. By contrast, the observed pattern was more similar to, and fell within, the distribution obtained from simulations using Brownian motion combined with a directional trend. Thus, the observed data are consistent with a pattern of directional evolution for this lineage of recessing scallops.

So far this approach was restricted to single change point detection and we propose a straightforward analytical framework based on a recent multiple change point algorithm: the PELT algorithm, a dynamic programming pruning search method to find, within time series, the optimal combination of number and locations of change points. Data segments found by the algorithm are then sorted out with a supervised classification tree procedure to organize segments by movement classes. We apply this framework to investigate changes in variance in daily distances of a migratory bird, the Macqueen's Bustard, Chlamydotis macqueenii, and describe its movements in three classes: staging, non-migratory and migratory movements. Using simulation experiments, we show that the algorithm is robust to identify exact behavioral shift (on average more than 80% of the time) but that positive autocorrelation when present is likely to lead to the detection of false change points (in 36% of the iterations with an average of 1.97 (SE = 0.06) additional change points). A case study is provided to illustrate the biases associated with visual analysis of movement patterns compared to the reliability of our analytical framework. Technological improvement will provide new opportunities for the study of animal behavior, bringing along huge and various data sets, a growing challenge for biologists, and this straightforward and standardized framework could be an asset in the attempt to decipher animal behavior.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  44,10.3389/fevo.2014.00030     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),animal tracking;time series data;change point analysis;PELT algorithm;supervised classification tree;Chlamydotis macqueenii;migration;OSPREYS PANDION-HALIAETUS;MIGRATION PATTERNS;AUTUMN MIGRATION;TRACKING;MODELS;Animals;Algorithms;Animal Shells,,

The need to adequately model individuals' interactions with other group members has been recognized, particularly in order to differentiate the role of social forces in individual movement from environmental factors. However, to date, practical statistical methods, which can include group dynamics in animal movement models, have been lacking. We consider a flexible modelling framework that distinguishes a group-level model, describing the movement of the group's centre, and an individual-level model, such that each individual makes its movement decisions relative to the group centroid. The basic idea is framed within the flexible class of hidden Markov models, extending previous work on modelling animal movement by means of multistate random walks. While in simulation experiments parameter estimators exhibit some bias in non-ideal scenarios, we show that generally the estimation of models of this type is both feasible and ecologically informative. We illustrate the approach using real movement data from 11 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). Results indicate a directional bias towards a group centroid for reindeer in an encamped state. Though the attraction to the group centroid is relatively weak, our model successfully captures group-influenced movement dynamics. Specifically, as compared to a regular mixture of correlated random walks, the group dynamic model more accurately predicts the non-diffusive behaviour of a cohesive mobile group. As technology continues to develop, it will become easier and less expensive to tag multiple individuals within a group in order to follow their movements. Our work provides a first inferential framework for understanding the relative influences of individual versus group-level movement decisions. This framework can be extended to include covariates corresponding to environmental influences or body condition. As such, this framework allows for a broader understanding of the many internal and external factors that can influence an individual's movement.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  70     Total Times Cited:  70     Cited Reference Count:  31,10.1111/2041-210X.12155     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioural state;hidden Markov model;maximum likelihood;random walk;HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS;STATE-SPACE MODELS;TELEMETRY DATA;BEHAVIOR;Animal Shells;Animals,,

Occupancy models are frequently used to address this, but it is unclear what spatial scale the data represent. Although individual cameras monitor animal activity within a small target window in front of the device, many practitioners use these data to infer animal presence over larger, vaguely-defined areas. Animal movement is generally presumed to link these scales, but fine-scale heterogeneity in animal space use could disrupt this relationship. Methods We deployed cameras at 10 m intervals across a 0.6 ha forest plot to create an unprecedentedly dense sensor array that allows us to compare animal detections at these two scales. Using time-stamped camera detections we reconstructed fine-scale movement paths of four mammal species and characterized (a) how well animal use of a single camera represented use of the surrounding plot, (b) how well cameras detected animals, and (c) how these processes affected overall detection probability, p. We used these observations to parameterize simulations that test the performance of occupancy models in realistic scenarios. Results We document two important aspects of animal movement and how it affects sampling with passive detectors. First, animal space use is heterogeneous at the camera-trap scale, and data from a single camera may poorly represent activity in its surroundings. Second, cameras frequently (14-71%) fail to record passing animals. Our simulations show how this heterogeneity can introduce unmodeled variation into detection probability, biasing occupancy estimates for species with low p. Conclusions Occupancy or population estimates with camera traps could be improved by increasing camera reliability to reduce missed detections, adding covariates to model heterogeneity in p, or increasing the area sampled by each camera through different sampling designs or technologies.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  39,10.1186/s40462-021-00277-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PRESENCE-ABSENCE DATA;OCCUPANCY;COMMUNITIES;DISTANCE;MODELS,,

Largest uncertainties in the conceptualization of CRTM lies in the adequate description of the two main canopy architectural parameters: (1) the projection function (G) that describes the foliage inclination distribution in space and (2) the clumping function (Omega) that describes the aggregative nature of canopy elements. Herein, we explore the effects of different (simple to complex) representations of the G and Omega functions on simulations of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmitted through a middle-aged maritime pine canopy, using a scenario-based numerical experiment.        Initially we studied the nature of different G and Omega functions for a maritime pine stand using the data obtained using a cohort of ground-based instruments that measures canopy architecture (LAI-2000, TRAC, Digital Hemispherical Photography (DHP)). Further, we evaluated the performances of 15 CRTM scenarios that had various combinations of the G and Omega functions (or values) to predict the transmitted PAR below the overstory canopy (R-under). The performances of the scenarios were explored by comparing the simulated and measured daily average R-under for 293 days in 2008. We found that the best performance was showed by scenario S6 (bias +1%, RMSE = 32.42 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), NSE = 0.90) wherein the Omega function was described using the empirical function derived using the TRAC data, and the G function calculated using a leaf angle distribution function (LADF) employing the Goel and Strebel (1984) approach. The scenarios that used the Ellipsoidal LADF for the G-function showed a general tendency to overestimate R-under with poorer performances. Assumption of a spherical leaf angle distribution (G = 0.5) along with a Omega function developed by Kucharik et al. (1999) (scenario S3) showed a rather satisfying performance (bias = 2% RMSE = 33.31 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), NSE = 0.89). The scenario (S4) that assumed a random foliage distribution (Omega = 1) and a spherical leaf angle distribution (G=0.5), the most common method used in ecological models, showed the worst performance to predict the R-under (bias -34%, RMSE = 72.8 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), NSE = 0.40). With these observations we suggest that the dynamics of G and Omega function be explicitly defined in the CRTM modules that are used within ecological models. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To infer genuine patterns of biodiversity change in the fossil record, we must be able to accurately estimate relative differences in numbers of taxa (richness) despite considerable variation in sampling between time intervals. Popular subsampling (=interpolation) methods aim to standardise diversity samples by rarefying the data to equal sample size or equal sample completeness (=coverage). Standardising by sample size is misleading because it compresses richness ratios, thereby flattening diversity curves. However, standardising by coverage reconstructs relative richness ratios with high accuracy. Asymptotic richness extrapolators are widely used in ecology, but rarely applied to fossil data. However, a recently developed parametric extrapolation method, TRiPS (True Richness estimation using Poisson Sampling), specifically aims to estimate the true richness of fossil assemblages.        2. Here, we examine the suitability of a range of richness estimators (both interpolators and extrapolators) for fossil datasets, using simulations and a novel method for comparing the performance of richness estimators with empirical data. We constructed sampling-standardised discovery curves (SSDCs) for two datasets, each spanning 150 years of palaeontological research: Mesozoic dinosaurs at global scale, and Mesozoic-early Cenozoic tetrapods from North America. These approaches reveal how each richness estimator responds to both simulated best-case and empirical real-world accumulation of fossil occurrences.        3. We find that extrapolators can only truly standardise diversity data once sampling is sufficient for richness estimates to have asymptoted. Below this point, directly comparing extrapolated estimates derived from samples of different sizes may not accurately reconstruct relative richness ratios. When abundance distributions are not perfectly flat and sampling is moderate to good, but not perfect, TRiPS does not extrapolate, because it overestimates binomial sampling probabilities. Coverage-based interpolators, by contrast, generally yield more stable subsampled diversity estimates, even in the face of dramatic increases in face-value counts of species richness. Richness estimators that standardise by coverage are among the best currently available methods for reconstructing deep-time biodiversity patterns. However, we recommend the use of sampling-standardised discovery curves to understand how biased reporting of fossil occurrences may affect sampling-standardised diversity estimates.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  42     Total Times Cited:  42     Cited Reference Count:  45,10.1111/2041-210X.12987     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Dinosauria;diversity;extrapolation;fossil record;interpolation;sample coverage;shareholder quorum subsampling;species accumulation curve;PHANEROZOIC MARINE DIVERSIFICATION;DINOSAUR DIVERSITY;EXTRAPOLATION;POPULATION;RAREFACTION;SIZE;MACROEVOLUTIONARY;DISTRIBUTIONS;EXTINCTION;ANIMALS,,

The mapping process adopted the simplifying assumption that strontium (Sr) comes exclusively from weathering of the underlying bedrock. The scope of this bedrock-only mapping method is thus limited to systems where the contributions of other sources of Sr are minimal. In this paper, we build on this Sr-87/(86) Sr mapping method by developing a mixing model of Sr fluxes from multiple sources to the bioavailable Sr pool. The new multiple source model includes: (1) quantitative calculations of Sr fluxes from bedrock weathering using an empirical rock weathering model; and (2) addition of sub-models calculating the contribution of Sr fluxes from atmospheric aerosols based on outputs from global climate model simulations. We compared the performance of the new multiple source model and the bedrock-only mapping method in predicting observed values from two datasets of bioavailable Sr-87/(86) Sr from the circum-Caribbean region (Antilles and Mesoamerica). Although the bedrock-only method performs relatively well in Mesoamerica (n=99, MAE=0.00011, RMSE=0.00073), its prediction accuracy is lower for the Antillean dataset (n=287, MAE=0.0021, RMSE=0.0027).

Given the development of complex mathematical models and the growing computational processing power, simulation tools are becoming increasingly popular.        In order to simulate phylogenetic trees, most evolutionary biologists are forced to build their own algorithms or use existing tools built on different platforms and/or as standalone programmes. The absence of a simulation tool accommodating for user-chosen model specifications limits, amongst others, model testing and pipelining with approximate Bayesian computation methods or other subsequent statistical analysis.        We introduce TreeSimGM, an r-package simulation tool for phylogenetic trees under a general Bellman and Harris model. This package allows the user to specify any desired probability distribution for the waiting times until speciation and extinction (e.g. age-dependent speciation/extinction). Upon speciation, the user can specify whether one descendant species corresponds to the ancestor species inheriting its age or whether both descendant species are new species of age 0. Moreover, it is possible to scale the waiting time to speciation/extinction for newly formed species. Thus, TreeSimGM not only allows the user to simulate stochastic phylogenetic trees assuming several popular existing models, such as the Yule model, the constant-rate birth-death model, and proportional to distinguishable arrangement models, but it also allows the user to formulate new models for exploration. A short explanation of the supported models and a few examples of how to use our package are presented here.        As an r-package, TreeSimGM allows flexible and powerful stochastic phylogenetic tree simulations. Moreover, it facilitates the pipelining of outputs or inputs with other functions in r.

The joint analysis of species' evolutionary relatedness and their morphological evolution has offered much promise in understanding the processes that underpin the generation of biological diversity.        2. Disparity through time (DTT) is a popular method that estimates the relative trait disparity within and between subclades, and compares this to the null hypothesis that trait values follow Brownian evolution along the time-calibrated phylogenetic tree. To visualise the differences a confidence envelope is normally created by calculating, at every time point, the 97.5% minimum and 97.5% maximum disparity values from multiple simulations of the null model. The null hypothesis is rejected whenever the empirical DTT curve falls outside of this envelope, and these time periods may then be linked to events that may have sparked non-random trait evolution.        3. Here, simulated data are used to show this pointwise (ranking at each time point) method of envelope construction suffers from multiple testing and a poor, uncontrolled, false-positive rate. As a consequence it cannot be recommended. Instead, each DTT curve can be given a single rank based upon their most extreme disparity value, relative to all other curves, and across all time points. Ordering curves this way leads to a test that avoids multiple testing, but still allows construction of a confidence envelope. The null hypothesis is rejected if the empirical DTT curve is ranked within the most extreme 5% ranked curves from the null model. Comparison of the rank envelope curve to the Morphological Disparity Index and Node Height tests shows it to have generally higher power to detect non-Brownian trait evolution. An extension to allow simultaneous testing over multiple traits is also detailed.        4. Overall the results suggest the new rank envelope test should be used in null model testing for DTT analyses. The rank envelope method can easily be adapted into recently developed posterior predictive simulation methods used in model selection analyses. More generally, the rank envelope test should be adopted whenever a null model produces a vector of correlated values and the user wants to determine where the empirical data are different to the null model.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  27,10.1111/2041-210X.13006     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),adaptive radiation;comparative methods;disparity through time;macroevolution;morphological diversification;null model;phenotypic diversification;ADAPTIVE RADIATION;SPATIAL-PATTERNS;DIVERSITY;SHAPE;BODY;DISPARITY;FISHES,,

We model three types of events: (i) instantaneous tree-wide shifts in speciation rate; (ii) instantaneous tree-wide shifts in extinction rate and (iii) instantaneous tree-wide mass-extinction events. Each type of event is modelled as an independent compound Poisson process (CPP), where the waiting times between events are exponentially distributed with event-specific rate parameters. The magnitude of each event is drawn from an event-specific prior distribution. Parameters of the model are then estimated in a Bayesian statistical framework using a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. This Bayesian approach enables us to distinguish between tree-wide diversification-rate variation and mass-extinction events by specifying a biologically informed prior on the magnitude of mass-extinction events and empirical hyperpriors on the diversification-rate parameters. We demonstrate via simulation that this method has substantial power to detect the number of mass-extinction events and provides unbiased estimates of the timing of mass-extinction events, while exhibiting an appropriate (i.e. <5%) false-discovery rate, even when background diversification rates vary. Finally, we provide an empirical demonstration of this approach, which reveals that conifers experienced a major episode of mass extinction approximate to 23Ma. This new approach - the CPP on Mass-Extinction Times (CoMET) model - provides an effective tool for detecting the impact of mass-extinction events on molecular phylogenies, even when the history of those groups includes temporal variation in diversification rates and when the fossil history of those groups is poorly known.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  56     Total Times Cited:  56     Cited Reference Count:  67,10.1111/2041-210X.12563     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bayesian inference;birth-death stochastic-branching process;compound Poisson process model;lineage diversification rates;mass extinction;phylogeny;speciation;RECONSTRUCTED EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS;PLANT FOSSIL RECORD;BIRTH-DEATH-MODELS;DEPENDENT SPECIATION;TIME;DIVERSITY;INFERENCE;TREES;SHIFTS;PROBABILITY,,

Using quantitative methods to analyse fossil occurrence data, one may infer rates of speciation and extinction in a Bayesian framework. Moreover, Silvestro et al. (2015a) recently developed a Multiple Clade Diversity Dependence birth-death model (MCDD) to determine whether diversification dynamics can be explained by positive or negative effects of interactions within or between co-existing clades. However, the power and accuracy of this model and its general applicability have yet to be thoroughly investigated.        Aims: Explore the properties of the existing MCDD implementation, which is based on Bayesian variable selection. Introduce an alternative parameterization based on the Horseshoe prior and show the properties of this approach for Bayesian shrinkage in complex models. Test the ability of the model to correctly identify within and between diversification interference under a suite of different diversification scenarios.        Methods: Use simulations to assess and compare the power and accuracy of the two algorithms.        Results: Diversity dependence within and between clades can be inferred with confidence in a wide range of scenarios using the MCDD model. The two implementations provide comparable results, but the new Horseshoe prior estimator appears to be more reliable, albeit slightly more conservative. The MCDD model is a powerful framework to analyse the putative effects of ecological interactions on macroevolutionary dynamics using fossil data and provides a sound statistical basis for future method developments.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  61,,Bayesian shrinkage;diversity dependence;fossils;macroevolution;SPECIES-DIVERSITY;RED QUEEN;DIVERSIFICATION;EXTINCTION;SPECIATION;EVOLUTION;DYNAMICS;MAMMALS;RECORD;TAXA,,

Comparative methods have sought to reconstruct the geographic speciation history of clades, using data on phylogeny and species geographic ranges. However, inference from comparative methods has been limited by uncertainty over whether contemporary biodiversity data retain the historic signal of speciation. We constructed a process-based simulation model to determine the influence of speciation mode and postspeciation range evolution on current biodiversity patterns. The simulations suggest that the signal of speciation history remains detectable in species distributions and phylogeny, even when species ranges have evolved substantially through time. We extracted this signal by using a combination of summary statistics that had good power to distinguish speciation modes and then used these statistics to infer the speciation history of 30 plant and animal clades. The results point to broad taxonomic patterns in the modes of speciation, with strongest support for founder speciation in mammals and birds and strongest support for sympatric speciation in plants.

Four general sources of uncertainty effect the outcome of process-based models: (i) uncertainty of information used to initialise and drive the model, (ii) uncertainty of model parameters describing specific ecosystem processes, (iii) uncertainty of the model structure, and (iv) accurateness of measurements (e.g., soil-atmosphere greenhouse gas exchange) which are used for model testing and development.        The aim of our study was to assess the simulation uncertainty of the process-based biogeochemical model LandscapeDNDC. For this we set up a Bayesian framework using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, to estimate the joint model parameter distribution. Data for model testing, parameter estimation and uncertainty assessment were taken from observations of soil fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as observed over a 10 yr period at the spruce site of the Hoglwald Forest, Germany. By running four independent Markov Chains in parallel with identical properties (except for the parameter start values), an objective criteria for chain convergence developed by Gelman et al. (2003) could be used.        Our approach shows that by means of the joint parameter distribution, we were able not only to limit the parameter space and specify the probability of parameter values, but also to assess the complex dependencies among model parameters used for simulating soil C and N trace gas emissions. This helped to improve the understanding of the behaviour of the complex LandscapeDNDC model while simulating soil C and N turnover processes and associated C and N soil-atmosphere exchange.        In a final step the parameter distribution of the most sensitive parameters determining soil-atmosphere C and N exchange were used to obtain the parameter-induced uncertainty of simulated N2O, NO and CO2 emissions. These were compared to observational data of an calibration set (6 yr) and an independent validation set of 4 yr.        The comparison showed that most of the annual observed trace gas emissions were in the range of simulated values and were predicted with a high certainty (Root-mean-squared error (RMSE) NO: 2.4 to 18.95 g N ha(-1) d(-1), N2O: 0.14 to 21.12 g N ha(-1) d(-1), CO2: 5.4 to 11.9 kg C ha(-1) d(-1)).

Various biogeochemical process-based models have been set up to estimate the GPP based on mathematical representation of biological, physiological and ecological processes. However, they ended up increasing the complexity and computational processing power due to the large number of physical equations that need to be solved. Computational time becomes an important matter in the simulation of multiple scenarios using models for long periods of time (e.g. climate projections). Data driven surrogate models have proven to be a useful tool for environmental modelling especially when ecological and climatic co-variates are large. The advantages of Data Driven Models (DDM) are: the possibility of adding new independent variables even if their understanding is weak, and short computational time to run. The aim is to explore the ability of DDMs to replicate a biochemical model calculating GPP. This study evaluates the performance of four surrogate DDMs, namely linear regression method (LRM), model tree (MT), instance-based learning (IBL) and artificial neural network (ANN). A simple empirical and semi-empirical relationship between GPP and climatic variables are studied. Input variable selection (IVS) methods were used to decide on the most relevant and potential environmental model inputs and then followed by a two-step approach which included a model-free and a model-based technique. Data from the highlands (paramo ecosystem) in the Ecuadorian Andean Region from 12-year time-series (2000-2011) were used to evaluate the models at various time frames and at different altitudes. The GPP time series data for the same period were derived from an earlier study using the biomodel BIOME-BGC (BioGeochemical Cycles), which is a comprehensive physical based model used in different analysis of carbon fluxes around the world. So-called IBL (nearest neighbour method) showed a great capability to reproduce the GPP when data was aggregated to monthly time frame. The computational time used to evaluate the time series with IBL as the selected DDM is shorter with enough accuracy for using it in multi-model runs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Location Applicable worldwide. Methods We computed distance-decay curves from simulated communities to assess how the species range sizes shape the functional form of distance-decay patterns (i.e. negative exponential, power-law or sigmoidal [Gompertz] relationships). Simulations were performed using different sample sizes and species detection probabilities. We also used distribution data of South American mammals to explore the relationship between species range size and the distance-decay form in an empirical dataset. Results Our simulations showed that the power-law is the best supported model when range sizes tend to be small. An increase in range sizes leads to a negative exponential relationship, taking the shape of a sigmoidal (Gompertz) relationship with the largest range size values. Similar results have been found in the distance-decay pattern of South American mammals. Remarkably, the Gompertz function fits the data reasonably well in all scenarios. Main conclusions The functional form of distance-decay patterns depends on a key biogeographical attribute: species range size. This dependence makes it an interesting tool to detect biodiversity threats associated with species range expansion, such as the biotic homogenization of faunas.

As such, we evaluate which model provided the most accurate diet es-timates by feeding Lake Trout known mixtures of prey for up to 12 weeks. Visualizations of Lake Trout fatty acid profiles using nMDS or linear discriminant analysis indicated distinct fatty acid profiles for each of the seven diet-treatment groups, with profiles from mixed diet treatments within a resource polygon outlined by those from monotypic diet treatments. Despite optimistic ordinations, all three diet estimation methods estimated diet com-positions with errors of 7.3-35.0% per prey item per Lake Trout. Errors did not seem to improve with greater feed-ing time, increases in length, mass, or lipids of Lake Trout, nor with a reduced suite of fatty acids. We cannot rule out the effects of malnutrition or differential nutrient offerings on consumers' fatty acid profiles but argue nor could one with wild organisms.

Due to growing computational power and a diversity of software with different capabilities, simulations are becoming increasingly powerful and useful. However, the widespread use of simulations by geneticists and ecologists is hindered by difficulties in understanding these softwares' complex capabilities, composing code and input files, a daunting bioinformatics barrier and a steep conceptual learning curve. SKELESIM (an R package) guides users in choosing appropriate simulations, setting parameters, calculating genetic summary statistics and organizing data output, in a reproducible pipeline within the R environment. SKELESIM is designed to be an extensible framework that can 'wrap' around any simulation software (inside or outside the R environment) and be extended to calculate and graph any genetic summary statistics. Currently, SKELESIM implements coalescent and forward-time models available in the FASTSIMCOAL2 and RMETASIM simulation engines to produce null distributions for multiple population genetic statistics and marker types, under a variety of demographic conditions. SKELESIM is intended to make simulations easier while still allowing full model complexity to ensure that simulations play a fundamental role in molecular ecology investigations. SKELESIM can also serve as a teaching tool: demonstrating the outcomes of stochastic population genetic processes; teaching general concepts of simulations; and providing an introduction to the R environment with a user-friendly graphical user interface (using shiny).",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  43,10.1111/1755-0998.12607     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),conservation genetics;forward-time;null model;open-source;population genetics;power analysis;simulations;the coalescent;LANDSCAPE GENETICS;EVOLUTIONARY;SOFTWARE;PROGRAM;PACKAGE;DIVERSITY;MARKERS;UTILITY;SAMPLES;NUMBER,,

This study aims at filling this gap by assessing the performance of genome-scan methods that consider explicitly the physical linkage among SNPs surrounding a selected variant. Our study compares the performance of seven recent methods for the detection of selective sweeps (iHS, nSL, EHHST, xp-EHH, XP-EHHST, XPCLR and hapFLK). We use an individual-based simulation approach to investigate the power and accuracy of these methods under a wide range of population models under both hard and soft sweeps. Our results indicate that XPCLR and hapFLK perform best and can detect soft sweeps under simple population structure scenarios if migration rate is low. All methods perform poorly with moderate-to-high migration rates, or with weak selection and very poorly under a hierarchical population structure. Finally, no single method is able to detect both starting and nearly completed selective sweeps.

We aimed to investigate the dispersal gradients of two rusts of wheat with spores of similar size, mass and shape, over multiple spatial scales. We hypothesized that a single dispersal kernel could fit the dispersal from all spatial scales well, and that it would be possible to obtain similar results in spatiotemporal increase of disease when modelling based on differing scales. Location Central Oregon and St. Croix Island. Taxa Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, Triticum aestivum. Methods We compared empirically derived primary disease gradients of cereal rust across three spatial scales: local (inoculum source and sampling unit = 0.0254 m, spatial extent = 1.52 m) field-wide (inoculum source = 1.52 m, sampling unit = 0.305 m and spatial extent = 91.4 m) and regional (inoculum source and sampling unit = 152 m, spatial extent = 10.5 km). We then examined whether disease spread in spatially explicit simulations depended upon the scale at which data were collected by constructing a compartmental time-step model. Results The three data sets could be fit well by a single power law dispersal kernel. Simulating epidemic spread at different spatial resolutions resulted in similar patterns of spatiotemporal spread. Dispersal kernel data obtained at one spatial scale can be used to represent spatiotemporal disease spread at a larger spatial scale. Main Conclusions Organisms spread by aerially dispersed small propagules that exhibit LDD may follow similar dispersal patterns over a several hundred- or thousand-fold expanse of spatial scale.

Observation uncertainty, a consequence of sampling effort and design as well as the process of observation, is still understudied, with little attention given to the multiple potential sources of error involved. To establish error minimization priorities and maximize monitoring efficiency, the direction and magnitude of multiple sources of uncertainty must be considered. Using monitoring of two contrasting ungulate species in the Serengeti ecosystem as a case study, we developed a virtual ecologist' framework within which we carried out simulated tests of different monitoring strategies for different types of species. We investigated which components of monitoring should be prioritized to increase survey accuracy and precision and explored the robustness of population estimates under different budgetary scenarios. The relative importance of each process affecting precision and accuracy varied according to the survey technique and biological characteristics of the species. While survey precision was mainly affected by population characteristics and sampling effort, the accuracy of the survey was greatly affected by observer effects, such as juvenile and herd detectability. Synthesis and applications. Monitoring efficiency is of the utmost importance for conservation, especially in the context of limited budgets and other priorities. We provide insights into the likely effect of different types of observation and process error on population estimates for savanna ungulates, and more generally present a framework for evaluating monitoring programmes in a virtual environment. In highly aggregated species, the main focus should be on survey precision; sampling effort should be defined according to wildlife spatial distribution.

Bayesian approaches in particular offer tremendous flexibility for SCR modeling. Increasingly, SCR data are being collected over very large spatial extents making analysis computational intensive, sometimes prohibitively so. To mitigate the computational burden of large-scale SCR models, we developed an improved formulation of the Bayesian SCR model that uses local evaluation of the individual state-space (LESS). Based on prior knowledge about a species' home range size, we created square evaluation windows that restrict the spatial domain in which an individual's detection probability (detector window) and activity center location (AC window) are estimated. We used simulations and empirical data analyses to assess the performance and bias of SCR with LESS. LESS produced unbiased estimates of SCR parameters when the AC window width was >= 5 sigma (sigma: the scale parameter of the half-normal detection function), and when the detector window extended beyond the edge of the AC window by 2 sigma. Importantly, LESS considerably decreased the computation time needed for fitting SCR models. In our simulations, LESS increased the computation speed of SCR models up to 57-fold. We demonstrate the power of this new approach by mapping the density of an elusive large carnivore-the wolverine (Gulo gulo)-with an unprecedented resolution and across the species' entire range in Norway (> 200,000 km(2)). Our approach helps overcome a major computational obstacle to population and landscape-level SCR analyses.

The goal was to design a sampling plan for detecting change in the density of breeding birds of 6 species occurring along the Colorado River around and south of Lake Mead in the southwestern United States. The main problem in designing the study was that the focal species were concentrated in small, irregularly shaped patches of habitat. We partitioned the study area into >15,000 plots configured to enclose the high-quality habitat in the fewest possible plots with the constraint that plots could be surveyed in 1 morning by 1 person. Because of the irregular plot shapes and extremely dense vegetation, we used area searches to carry out the surveys. We used double-sampling, including a large sample of plots surveyed with a rapid method and a subsample of plots surveyed intensively, to estimate detection ratios. A simulation study helped allocate effort between rapid and intensive surveys and indicated that conducting 80 surveys per year would achieve high power to detect a 50% decline occurring during 20 years.

Statistical estimators are often less biased. Nonparametric estimators of species richness are widely considered the least biased, but no particular estimator has consistently performed best. This is partly a function of estimators responding differently to assemblage-level factors and survey design parameters. Our objective was to evaluate the performance of raw counts and nonparametric estimators of species richness across various assemblages and with different survey designs.        Location        We used both simulated and published field data.        Methods        We evaluated the bias, precision and accuracy of raw counts and 13 nonparametric estimators using simulations that systematically varied assemblage characteristics (number of species, species abundance distribution, total number of individuals, spatial configuration of individuals and species detection probability), sampling effort and survey design.        Results informed the development of an estimator selection framework that we evaluated with field data.        Results        When averaged across assemblages, most nonparametric estimators were less negatively biased than a raw count. Estimators based on the similarity of repeated subsets of surveys were most accurate and their accumulation curves appeared to reach asymptotes fastest. Number of species, species abundance distribution and effort had the largest effects on performance, ultimately by affecting the proportion of the species pool contained in a sample. Our estimator selection framework showed promising results when applied to field data.        Main conclusions        A raw count of the number of species in an area is far from the best estimate of true species richness. Nonparametric estimators are less biased. Newer largely unused, estimators perform better than more well known and longer established counterparts under certain conditions.

However, quantifying range expansion rates may be heavily influenced by methodology and/or sampling bias. We compared expansion rate estimates of Roesel's bush-cricket (Metrioptera roeselii, Hagenbach 1822), a nonnative species currently expanding its range in south-central Sweden, from range statistic models based on distance measures (mean, median, 95th gamma quantile, marginal mean, maximum, and conditional maximum) and an area-based method (grid occupancy). We used sampling simulations to determine the sensitivity of the different methods to incomplete sampling across the species' range. For periods when we had comprehensive survey data, range expansion estimates clustered into two groups: (1) those calculated from range margin statistics (gamma, marginal mean, maximum, and conditional maximum: similar to 3 km/year), and (2) those calculated from the central tendency (mean and median) and the area-based method of grid occupancy (similar to 1.5 km/year). Range statistic measures differed greatly in their sensitivity to sampling effort; the proportion of sampling required to achieve an estimate within 10% of the true value ranged from 0.17 to 0.9. Grid occupancy and median were most sensitive to sampling effort, and the maximum and gamma quantile the least. If periods with incomplete sampling were included in the range expansion calculations, this generally lowered the estimates (range 16-72%), with exception of the gamma quantile that was slightly higher (6%). Care should be taken when interpreting rate expansion estimates from data sampled from only a fraction of the full distribution. Methods based on the central tendency will give rates approximately half that of methods based on the range margin.

However, divergence beyond the within-species level will necessarily reduce the number of conserved and non-duplicated restriction sites, and therefore the number of loci usable for phylogenetic inference. Here, we assess the suitability of RAD-seq for phylogeny using a simulated experiment on the 12 Drosophila genomes, with divergence times ranging from 5 to 63 million years. These simulations show that RAD-seq allows the recovery of the known Drosophila phylogeny with strong statistical support, even for relatively ancient nodes. Notably, this conclusion is robust to the potentially confounding effects of sequencing errors, heterozygosity, and low coverage. We further show that clustering RAD-seq data using the BLASTN and SiLiX programs significantly improves the recovery of orthologous RAD loci compared with previously proposed approaches, especially for distantly related species. This study therefore validates the view that RAD sequencing is a powerful tool for phylogenetic inference.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  120     Total Times Cited:  121     Cited Reference Count:  19,10.1002/ece3.512     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bioinfomatics;phyloinfomatics;molecular evolution;phylogenetic theory and methods;phylogeography;EVOLUTION;Computer Simulation,,

However, these models are powerful conservation tools only if they are biologically relevant, and thus validation of these models is essential. Here, we evaluate four model selection frameworks for their ability to identify a best fit model of spread under low data conditions early in an invasion, specifically testing the efficacy of methods that utilize absence data in addition to presence data in evaluating models. We test this question using a simulation where we generated data with varying confidence in the accuracy of the absence data, as absences in early invasions may become presences in the future, and increasing quantity of observation data to test the models. We create these simulations based on a real-world example of a newly emergent, invasive fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal). The simulation demonstrated that AIC and Likelihood consistently outperform both Kappa and AUC in selecting the true model as the best model when data are limited and absence data are low quality, with AIC providing the most conservative results due to penalties for overparameterization. With these results, we then used these techniques to compare five candidate models for predicting the spread of Bsal. Consistent with the simulation, the best fit model of the candidate models for Bsal was inconsistent across the four metrics. However, AIC, which performed best in the simulation study, suggested that the spread of Bsal into Western Europe was best predicted by a combination of bioclimatic suitability, salamander richness, and number of salamander imports. Our results highlight the difficulty in evaluating predictive models when data are limited and of low quality, as with a newly invasive species, but show that these challenges can be partially addressed with the appropriate model selection approach. Use of this approach is critical as SDMs of invasive species are often used to inform conservation policy and efforts before the invasion spreads, when limited data are available.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  50,10.1007/s10530-018-1690-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),AUC;AIC;Kappa;Likelihood;Amphibian conservation;Chytrid;Maxent;Species distribution model;PREVALENCE;DISTRIBUTIONS;COMPLEXITY;CRITERIA;BIAS,,

Fifteen demographic models were compared, and our results support a model of recent dispersal from coastal to inland rainforests.

However, no consensus yet exists on the reliability of such models for drawing conclusions on species' distribution response to changing climate. In this study, we provide an overview of common modelling practices in the field and assess the reliability of model predictions using a virtual species approach.        Location Global.        Methods We first review papers published between 2015 and 2019. Then, we use a virtual species approach and three commonly applied SDM algorithms (GLM, MaxEnt and random forest) to assess the estimated and actual predictive performance of models parameterized with different modelling settings and violations of modelling assumptions.        Results Most SDM papers relied on single models (65%) and small samples (N < 50, 62%), used presence-only data (85%), binarized models' output (74%) and used a split-sample validation (94%). Our simulation reveals that the split-sample validation tends to be over-optimistic compared to the real performance, whereas spatial block validation provides a more honest estimate, except when datasets are environmentally biased. The binarization of predicted probabilities of presence reduces models' predictive ability considerably. Sample size is one of the main predictors of the real model accuracy, but has little influence on estimated accuracy. Finally, the inclusion of ecologically irrelevant predictors and the violation of modelling assumptions increases estimated accuracy but decreases real accuracy of model projections, leading to biased estimates of range contraction and expansion.        Main conclusions Our ability to predict future species distribution is low on average, particularly when models' predictions are binarized. A robust validation by spatially independent samples is required, but does not rule out inflation of model accuracy by assumption violation.

The goal of this study was to determine a range of values for the new tile drain parameters and to use measured streamflow data from the South Fork Watershed (SFW) in Iowa to evaluate the capability of the Modified SWAT to simulate water balance components for this tile-drained watershed. This was accomplished by reviewing literature of tile drainage studies and by comparing measured streamflow with that predicted by the Modified SWAT using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and percent bias (PBIAS [%]) statistical methods in addition to hydrographs. During the calibration period, the Modified SWAT simulated streamflow very well (monthly NSE = 0.85 and PBIAS = +/-2.3%). During the validation period, the Modified SWAT model simulated streamflow well (monthly NSE = 0.70 and PBIAS = +/-2.5%). Simulated water balance results indicated that the soil water with tile drainage (260 mm [10 in]) was significantly (p-value = 0.00) lower than soil water without tile drainage (353 mm [14 in]), while streamflow with (205 mm [8 in]) tile drainage was significantly (p-value = 0.03) greater than streamflow without (128 mm[ 5 in]) tile drainage.

Location World-wide.        Methods We identified four important plant traits: leaf N concentration, leaf life span, fraction of net primary production (NPP) allocated to leaves and plant basal respiration rate. We incorporated means and variances of these plant traits from trait databases into the Community Atmosphere-Biosphere-Land Exchange model. We then predicted the dominant PFT or PFT mixture for global forested grid cells, using NPP as a proxy for growth rate, and considering three PFTs: evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF), evergreen broadleaf forests (EBF) and deciduous broadleaf forests (DBF). We compared results with: (1) those from simulations that did not account for trait variance; (2) results from an empirical model based purely on mean annual temperature; and (3) data from remotely sensed observations.        Results Our estimates of the fractions of land area covered by major forest types were consistent with observation; i.e. ENFs dominate in boreal regions, EBFs dominate in tropical regions and DBFs are distributed widely across a broad range of environmental conditions. We also showed that co-dominance of different forest PFTs cannot be reproduced without considering variation in plant traits.

The island's mountainous regions are thought to have played a role in lineage and species diversification, but this has yet to be explored across taxonomic groups and a temporal context has not yet been identified. We tested whether montane regions have promoted population divergence in Madagascar's vertebrate fauna and, if so, whether these divergence events were contemporaneous. Location Moist evergreen forests of Madagascar. Taxa Small mammals and reptiles. Methods We analysed mitochondrial DNA data from 20 small-mammal and five reptile species widely distributed across Madagascar's moist evergreen forests. We used phylogenetic and population genetic analyses to identify major phylogeographic patterns, then used linear regression to determine if the strength of phylogeographic structure is related to taxon, body size or elevation. Finally, we tested whether or not divergence across highlands occurred synchronously in multiple species, and used simulations to assess the power of these analyses to accurately estimate divergence times. Results We observed a shared phylogeographic pattern across multiple species that suggests Madagascar's northern, central and southern highlands have served as important regions of diversification on Madagascar. This pattern was recovered across taxa with varying body sizes and elevational distributions. We also identified four pulses of divergence between the northern and central highlands since the late Miocene, although simulations suggest that our empirical data cannot recover the number or timing of divergence events with high certainty. Finally, we observed several instances of deep intraspecific genetic splits, suggesting that several of the species we evaluated may represent cryptic species complexes.

We evaluated the impact of employing concatenation and coalescent-based phylogeny inference in recovering the correct macroevolutionary regime using simulated data based on the well-established diversification rate shift of delphinids in Cetacea. We found that under scenarios of strong incomplete lineage sorting, macroevolutionary analysis of phylogenies inferred by concatenating loci failed to recover the delphinid diversification shift, while the coalescent-based tree consistently retrieved the correct rate regime. We suggest that ignoring microevolutionary processes reduces the power of methods that estimate macroevolutionary regimes from molecular data.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  50,10.1002/ece3.4212     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),concatenation;diversification;multispecies coalescent;simulation;SPECIES TREE ESTIMATION;MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD;COALESCENT METHODS;DIVERSIFICATION;DIVERGENCE;SPECIATION;EVOLUTION;PHYLOGEOGRAPHY;PERFORMANCE;RADIATION,,

One complication for individual-based methods is that gene flow and landscape variables are often correlated with geography. Partial statistics, particularly Mantel tests, are often employed to control for these inherent correlations by removing the effects of geography while simultaneously correlating measures of genetic differentiation and landscape variables of interest. Concerns about the reliability of Mantel tests prompted this study, in which we use simulated landscapes to evaluate the performance of partial Mantel tests and two ordination methods, distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) and redundancy analysis (RDA), for detecting isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by landscape resistance (IBR). Specifically, we described the effects of suitable habitat amount, fragmentation and resistance strength on metrics of accuracy (frequency of correct results, type I/II errors and strength of IBR according to underlying landscape and resistance strength) for each test using realistic individual-based gene flow simulations. Mantel tests were very effective for detecting IBD, but exhibited higher error rates when detecting IBR. Ordination methods were overall more accurate in detecting IBR, but had high type I errors compared to partial Mantel tests. Thus, no one test outperformed another completely. A combination of statistical tests, for example partial Mantel tests to detect IBD paired with appropriate ordination techniques for IBR detection, provides the best characterization of fine-scale landscape genetic structure. Realistic simulations of empirical data sets will further increase power to distinguish among putative mechanisms of differentiation.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  57     Total Times Cited:  57     Cited Reference Count:  57,10.1111/1755-0998.12332     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),landscape genetics;Mantel test;ordination;partial statistics;redundancy analysis;MOVEMENT BEHAVIOR;HABITAT FRAGMENTATION;MANTEL TEST;POPULATION;FLOW;DIFFERENTIATION;RESISTANCE;INFERENCE;HETEROGENEITY;CONNECTIVITY,,

Despite the development of efficient noninvasive sampling methods and robust statistical tools to estimate abundance, the maintenance of field sampling is still subject to economic and logistic constraints. These can result in intentional or unintentional interruptions in sampling and cause gaps in data time series, posing a challenge to abundance estimation, and ultimately conservation and management decisions. We applied an open population spatial capture-recapture (OPSCR) model to simulations and a real-life case study to test the reliability of abundance inference to interruptions in data collection. Using individual detections occurring over consecutive sampling occasions, OPSCR models allow the estimation of abundance while accounting for lack of demographic and geographic closure between occasions. First, we simulated sampling data with interruptions in field sampling of different lengths and timing and checked the performance of an OPSCR model in deriving abundance for species with slow and intermediate life-history strategies. Next, we introduced artificial sampling interruptions of various magnitudes and timing to a five-year noninvasive monitoring data set of wolverines (Gulo gulo) in Norway and quantified the consequences for OPSCR model predictions. Inferences from OPSCR models were reliable even with temporal interruptions in monitoring. Interruption did not cause systematic bias, but increased uncertainty. Interruptions occurring at occasions near the beginning and the end of the sampling period caused higher uncertainty. The loss in precision was more severe for species with a faster life-history strategy. OPSCR allows monitoring studies to provide contiguous abundance estimates to managers, stakeholders, and policy makers even when data are noncontiguous. OPSCR models do not only help cope with unintentional interruptions during sampling but also offer opportunities for using intentional sampling interruptions during the design of cost-effective population surveys.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  51,10.1002/ecs2.3172     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),cost efficiency;density;monitoring;gaps;population dynamics;Wolverine (Gulo gulo);STATE-SPACE;SURVIVAL;HISTORY,,

One widely used method, the residual diversity' method, uses residuals from a modelled relationship between palaeodiversity and sampling (sampling-driven diversity model) as corrected' diversity estimates, but the unorthodox way in which these residuals are generated presents serious statistical problems; the response and predictor variables are decoupled through independent sorting, rendering the new bivariate relationship meaningless. Here, we use simple simulations to demonstrate the detrimental consequences of independent sorting, through assessing error rates and biases in regression model coefficients. Regression models based on independently sorted data result in unacceptably high rates of incorrect and systematically, directionally biased estimates, when the true parameter values are known. The large number of recent papers that used the method are likely to have produced misleading results and their implications should be reassessed. We note that the residuals' approach based on the sampling-driven diversity model cannot be used to correct' for sampling bias, and instead advocate the use of phylogenetic multiple regression models that can include various confounding factors, including sampling bias, while simultaneously accounting for statistical non-independence owing to shared ancestry.

However, unless the population is very small or fragmented, software may be required to pre-screen and reject most image pairs as potential matches. Depending on the species and method used to obtain images, currently available software may falsely reject some matches. We estimate the false rejection rate (FRR) of the ExtractCompare (EC) program when used to pre-screen images of female grey seals. Filtering images manually to reduce the FRR involves subjective assessment of image quality, reduces the amount of data available and may bias the results in favour of relatively well-marked individuals. The data may contain individuals identified only from the left side or the right side, as well as individuals identified from both sides. Missed matches resulting from false rejections by pre-screening software and/or inclusion of individuals identified only from opposite sides cause some individuals to generate multiple encounter histories. We describe an open population model for data of this type which, given a measured risk of missing a match between a randomly selected pair of images of the same individual, provides maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of initial population size, survival/emigration and immigration/recruitment by calculating the expected frequency of any encounter history that could be generated. As a case study for the method, we used EC to pre-screen photographs of female grey seals on a breeding colony and generate encounter histories over five successive seasons. Allowing for the measured FRR, we calculated ML estimates for comparison with estimates from previous studies. We also used the model with encounter histories simulated using the same FRR to give the same mixture of left side, right side and both sides histories and derived ML estimates for comparison with the values used to drive the simulation. With FRR set at up to 33%, the method gave estimates of the abundance and survival parameters used in the simulation model that were biased by at most 4 center dot 7% up and 3% down, respectively.

In general, most authors agree that the best approach is to incorporate multiple calibrations to avoid the risk of bias associated with a single dating source. However, the indiscriminate inclusion of as many calibration points as possible can lead to tree shape distortion and an overestimation of the variation in evolutionary rates among branches due to errors in the geological, paleontological or paleogeographic information used for dating.        We present a test of congruence among calibration hypotheses to assist their filtering prior to molecular clock analysis, which we have called Bayes Factor Cluster Analysis (BFCA). This is a heuristic method based on the comparison of pairwise calibrations hypotheses by Bayes factors that allows identifying sets of congruent calibrations.        We have tested BFCA through simulation using beast and mcmctree programs and analysed a real case of multiple calibration hypotheses to date the evolution of the genus Carabus (Coleoptera: Carabidae).        The analyses of simulated data showed the predictability of change in Bayes factors when comparing alternative calibration hypotheses on a particular tree topology, and thus the suitability of BFCA in identifying unreliable calibrations, especially in cases with limited variation in evolutionary rates among branches. The exclusion of inconsistent calibrations as identified by BFCA produced significant changes in the estimation of divergence times and evolutionary rates in the genus Carabus, illustrating the importance of filtering calibrations before analyses.        The method has been implemented in an open-source R package called bfca to simplify its application.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  65,10.1111/2041-210X.12151     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bayes Factor Cluster Analysis;Bayes factors;molecular clock;substitution rate;calibration hypotheses;GENE-SEQUENCES COLEOPTERA;DIVERGENCE TIME;FOSSIL CALIBRATIONS;EVOLUTIONARY RATE;SUBSTITUTION RATES;MODEL SELECTION;MITOCHONDRIAL;DNA;PHYLOGENETICS;CARABUS;Calibration,,

Moran's Eigenvector Maps are a promising method that does not make an assumption of isolation-by-distance in a homogeneous environment but can discern cryptic structure that may result from multiple processes operating in heterogeneous landscapes. MEMgene uses spatial filters from Moran's Eigenvector Maps as predictor variables to explain variation in a genetic distance matrix, and it returns adjusted R-2 as a measure of the amount of genetic variation that is spatially structured. However, it is unclear whether, and under which conditions, this value can be used to compare the degree of spatial genetic structure (effect size) between studies. This study addresses the fundamental question of comparability at two levels: between independent studies (meta-analysis mode) and between species sampled at the same locations (comparative mode). We used published datasets containing 9,900 haploid, biallelic, neutral loci simulated on a quasi-continuous, square landscape under four demographic scenarios (island model, isolation-by-distance, expansion from one or two refugia). We varied the genetic resolution (number of individuals and loci) and the number of random sampling locations. We considered two measures of effect size, the MEMgene adjusted R-2 and multivariate Moran's I, which is related to Moran's Eigenvector Maps. Both metrics were highly sensitive to the number of locations, even when using standardized effect sizes, SES, and the number of individuals sampled per location, but not to the number of loci. In comparative mode, using the same Moran Eigenvector Maps for all species, even those with missing values at some sampling locations, reduced bias due to the number of locations under isolation-by-distance (stationary process) but increased it under expansion from one or two refugia (non-stationary process). More robust measures of effect size need to be developed before the strength of spatial genetic structure can be accurately compared, either in a meta-analysis of independent empirical studies or within a comparative, multispecies landscape genetic study.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  49,10.3389/fevo.2021.612718     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),landscape genetics;simulation;MEMgene;comparative;genetic distance;meta-analysis;Moran&#8217;s I;adjusted R-squared;LANDSCAPE GENETICS;ECOLOGY;AUTOCORRELATION;CONNECTIVITY;FRAMEWORK;HISTORY;FLOW,,

Nowadays, in situ observations of carbon fluxes are abundant. However, the knowledge of how much data (data length) and which subset of the time series data (data period) should be used to effectively calibrate the model is still lacking. This study uses the AmeriFlux carbon flux data to parameterize the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) with an adjoint-based data assimilation technique for various ecosystem types. Parameterization experiments are thus conducted to explore the impact of both data length and data period on the uncertainty reduction of the posterior model parameters and the quantification of site and regional carbon dynamics. We find that: (1) the model is better constrained when it uses two-year data comparing to using one-year data. Further, two-year data is sufficient in calibrating TEM's carbon dynamics, since using three-year data could only marginally improve the model performance at our study sites; (2) the model is better constrained with the data that have a higher ""climate variability'' than that having a lower one. The climate variability is used to measure the overall possibility of the ecosystem to experience all climatic conditions including drought and extreme air temperatures and radiation; (3) the U.S. regional simulations indicate that the effect of calibration data length on carbon dynamics is amplified at regional and temporal scales, leading to large discrepancies among different parameterization experiments, especially in July and August. Our findings are conditioned on the specific model we used and the calibration sites we selected. The optimal calibration data length may not be suitable for other models. However, this study demonstrates that there may exist a threshold for calibration data length and simply using more data would not guarantee a better model parameterization and prediction. More importantly, climate variability might be an effective indicator of information within the data, which could help data selection for model parameterization.

Most movement exhibits directional bias that is related to environmental features (defined as taxis when biased orientation is voluntary), such as the location of food patches, predators, ocean currents or wind. Numerous behaviours with directional bias can be characterised by maintaining orientation at an angle relative to the environmental stimuli (menotaxis), including navigation relative to sunlight or magnetic fields and energy-conserving flight across wind. However, new methods are needed to flexibly classify and characterise such directional bias. We propose a biased correlated random walk model that can identify menotactic behaviours by predicting turning angle as a trade-off between directional persistence and directional bias relative to environmental stimuli without making a priori assumptions about the angle of bias. We apply the model within the framework of a multi-state hidden Markov model (HMM) and describe methods to remedy information loss associated with coarse environmental data to improve the classification and parameterisation of directional bias. Using simulation studies, we illustrate how our method more accurately classifies behavioural states compared to conventional correlated random walk HMMs that do not incorporate directional bias. We illustrate the application of these methods by identifying cross wind olfactory foraging and drifting behaviour mediated by wind-driven sea ice drift in polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from movement data collected by satellite telemetry. The extensions we propose can be readily applied to movement data to identify and characterise behaviours with directional bias towards any angle, and open up new avenues to investigate more mechanistic relationships between animal movement and the environment.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  75,10.1111/2041-210X.13681,behaviour;hidden Markov models;movement ecology;orientation;remote tracking;taxis;telemetry;SEA-ICE DRIFT;POLAR BEARS;URSUS-MARITIMUS;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;OLFACTORY SEARCH;OCEAN CURRENTS;PHOCA-HISPIDA;HUDSON-BAY;HABITAT;DYNAMICS,,

The use of Pearson's r as the classical measure for correlation is widespread in ecology, where manipulative experiments are impractical across the large spatial scales concerned; it is therefore vital that ecologists are able to use this correlation measure as effectively as possible. Here, our literature review suggests that corrections for the issue of underestimation in Pearson's r should not be adopted if either the data deviate from bivariate normality or sample size is greater than around 30. Through our simulations, we then aim to offer advice to researchers in ecology on situations where both distributions can be described as normal, but sample sizes are lower than around 30. We found that none of the methods currently offered in the literature to correct the underestimation bias offer consistently reliable performance, and so we do not recommend that they be implemented when making inferences about the behaviour of a population from a sample.

Different factors were shown to affect SDM prediction accuracy. However, real data cannot give unambiguous answers on these issues, and for this reason, artificial data have been increasingly used in recent years. Here, we move one step further by assessing how different factors can affect the prediction accuracy of virtual assemblages obtained by stacking individual SDM predictions (stacked SDMs, S-SDM). We modelled 100 virtual species in a real study area, testing five different factors: sample size (200.800-3200), sampling method (nested, non-nested), sampling prevalence (25%, 50%, 75% and species true prevalence), modelling technique (GAM, GLM, BRT and RF) and thresholding method (ROC, MaxTSS, and MaxKappa). We showed that the accuracy of S-SDM predictions is mostly affected by modelling technique followed by sample size. Models fitted by GAM/GLM had a higher accuracy and lower variance than BRT/RF. Model accuracy increased with sample size and a sampling strategy reflecting the true prevalence of the species was most successful. However, even with sample sizes as high as > 3000 sites, residual uncertainty remained in the predictions, potentially reflecting a bias introduced by creating and/or resampling the virtual species. Therefore, when evaluating the accuracy of predictions from S-SDMs fitted with real field data, one can hardly expect reaching perfect accuracy, and reasonably high values of similarity or predictive success can already be seen as valuable predictions. We recommend the use of a 'plot-like' sampling method (best approximation of the species' true prevalence) and not simply increasing the number of presences-absences of species. As presented here, virtual simulations might be used more systematically in future studies to inform about the best accuracy level that one could expect given the characteristics of the data and the methods used to fit and stack SDMs.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  78,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2018.09.002     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Virtual community ecologist;Stacked species distribution models;Nested design;Factors importance;Relative effects;Sampling effect;DISTRIBUTION MODELS;PERFORMANCE;RANGE;UNCERTAINTY;REGRESSION;FRAMEWORK;SCALE;AREA;OCCURRENCES;SENSITIVITY,,

One significant opportunity is leveraging rapidly increasing data resources from digitized museum specimens and community science platforms, but this assumes reliable statistical methods are available to estimate phenology using presence-only data. Estimating the onset or offset of key events is especially difficult with incidental data, as lower data densities occur towards the tails of an abundance distribution. The Weibull distribution has been recognized as an appropriate distribution to estimate phenology based on presence-only data, but Weibull-informed estimators are only available for onset and offset. We describe the mathematical framework for a new Weibull-parameterized estimator of phenology appropriate for any percentile of a distribution and make it available in anrpackage,phenesse. We use simulations and empirical data on open flower timing and first arrival of monarch butterflies to quantify the accuracy of our estimator and other commonly used phenological estimators for 10 phenological metrics: onset, mean and offset dates, as well as the 1st, 5th, 10th, 50th, 90th, 95th and 99th percentile dates. Root mean squared errors and mean bias of the phenological estimators were calculated for different patterns of abundance and observation processes. Results show a general pattern of decay in performance of estimates when moving from mean estimates towards the tails of the seasonal abundance curve, suggesting that onset and offset continue to be the most difficult phenometrics to estimate. However, with simple phenologies and enough observations, our newly developed estimator can provide useful onset and offset estimates. This is especially true for the start of the season, when incidental observations may be more common. Our simulation demonstrates the potential of generating accurate phenological estimates from presence-only data and guides the best use of estimators. The estimator that we developed, phenesse, is the least biased and has the lowest estimation error for onset estimates under most simulated and empirical conditions examined, improving the robustness of these estimates for phenological research.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  36,10.1111/2041-210X.13448,citizen science;global change;incidental data;phenological metrics;rpackage;seasonal abundance curves;simulated data;CLIMATE-CHANGE;STATISTICAL-INFERENCE;SPRING ARRIVAL;MODELS;SHIFTS;BOUNDS;DATES,,

The standard spatial capture-recapture design for sampling animal populations uses a fixed array of detectors, each operated for the same time. However, methods are needed to deal with the unbalanced data that may result from unevenness of effort due to logistical constraints, partial equipment failure or pooling of data for analysis.        2. We describe adjustments for varying effort for three types of data each with a different probability distribution for the number of observations per individual per detector per sampling occasion. A linear adjustment to the expected count is appropriate for Poisson-distributed counts (e.g. faeces per searched quadrat). A linear adjustment on the hazard scale is appropriate for binary (Bernoulli-distributed) observations at either traps or binary proximity detectors (e.g. automatic cameras). Data pooled from varying numbers of binary detectors have a binomial distribution; adjustment is achieved by varying the size parameter of the binomial.        3. We compared a hazard-based adjustment to a more conventional covariate approach in simulations of one temporal and one spatial scenario for varying effort. The hazard-based approach was the more parsimonious and appeared more resistant to bias and confounding.        4. We analysed a dataset comprising DNA identifications of female grizzly bears Ursus arctos sampled asynchronously with hair snares in British Columbia in 2007. Adjustment for variation in sampling interval had negligible effect on density estimates, but unmasked an apparent decline in detection probability over the season. Duration-dependent decay in sample quality is an alternative explanation for the decline that could be included in future models.        5. Allowing for known variation in effort ensures that estimates of detection probability relate to a consistent unit of effort and improves the fit of detection models. Failure to account for varying effort may result in confounding between effort and density variation in time or space. Adjustment for effort allows rigorous analysis of unbalanced data with little extra cost in terms of precision or processing time. We suggest it should become routine in capture-recapture analyses.

Large cooperative telemetry networks produce vast quantities of data useful in the study of movement, resource selection and species distribution. Efficient use of acoustic telemetry data requires estimation of acoustic source locations from detections at receivers (i.e., ""localization""). Multiple processes provide information for localization estimation including detection/non-detection data at receivers, information on signal rate, and an underlying movement model describing how individuals move and utilize space. Frequently, however, localization methods only integrate a subset of these processes and do not utilize the full spatial encounter history information available from receiver arrays. Methods In this paper we draw analogies between the challenges of acoustic telemetry localization and newly developed methods of spatial capture-recapture (SCR). We develop a framework for localization that integrates explicit sub-models for movement, signal (or cue) rate, and detection probability, based on acoustic telemetry spatial encounter history data. This method, which we call movement-assisted localization, makes efficient use of the full encounter history data available from acoustic receiver arrays, provides localizations with fewer than three detections, and even allows for predictions to be made of the position of an individual when it was not detected at all. We demonstrate these concepts by developing generalizable Bayesian formulations of the SCR movement-assisted localization model to address study-specific challenges common in acoustic telemetry studies. Results Simulation studies show that movement-assisted localization models improve point-wise RMSE of localization estimates by >50% and greatly increased the precision of estimated trajectories compared to localization using only the detection history of a given signal. Additionally, integrating a signal rate sub-model reduced biases in the estimation of movement, signal rate, and detection parameters observed in independent localization models. Conclusions Movement-assisted localization provides a flexible framework to maximize the use of acoustic telemetry data.

Yet, as these models become more complex and challenging to understand, it is important to consider what pitfalls these methods have and what opportunities there are for future research to address these pitfalls. In this paper, we review five lesser known pitfalls one can encounter when using HMMs or their extensions to solve ecological problems: (a) violation of the snapshot property in continuous-time HMMs; (b) biased inference from hierarchical HMMs when applied to temporally misaligned processes; (c) sensitive inference from using random effects to partially pool across heterogeneous individuals; (d) computational burden when using HMMs to approximate models with continuous state spaces; and (e) difficulty linking the hidden process to space or environment. This review is for ecologists and ecological statisticians familiar with HMMs, but who may be less aware of the problems that arise in more specialised applications. We demonstrate how each pitfall arises, by simulation or example, and discuss why this pitfall is important to consider. Along with identifying the problems, we highlight potential research opportunities and offer ideas that may help alleviate these pitfalls. Each of the methods we review are solutions to current ecological research problems. We intend for this paper to heighten awareness of the pitfalls ecologists may encounter when applying these more advanced methods, but we also hope that by highlighting future research opportunities, we can inspire ecological statisticians to weaken these pitfalls and provide improved methods.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  75,10.1111/2041-210X.13801,animal movement;continuous time;hidden Markov model;hierarchical model;population ecology;random effects;state space models;time series;ANIMAL MOVEMENT;SPACE MODELS;BEHAVIOR;PACKAGE,,

Therefore, estimating group density and size is often essential for understanding population dynamics, interspecific interactions, and conservation needs of group-living species. Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) has been used to model both individual and group density in group-living species, but modeling either individual-level or group-level detection results in different biases due to common characteristics of group-living species, such as highly cohesive movement or variation in group size. Furthermore, no SCR method currently estimates group density, individual density, and group size jointly. Using clustered point processes, we developed a cluster SCR model to estimate group density, individual density, and group size. We compared the model to standard SCR models using both a simulation study and a data set of detections of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), a group-living carnivore, on camera traps in northern Botswana. We then tested the model's performance under various scenarios of group movement in a separate simulation study. We found that the cluster SCR model outperformed a standard group-level SCR model when fitted to data generated with varying group sizes, and mostly recovered previous estimates of wild dog group density, individual density, and group size. We also found that the cluster SCR model performs better as individuals' movements become more correlated with their groups' movements. The cluster SCR model offers opportunities to investigate ecological hypotheses relating group size to population dynamics while accounting for cohesive movement behaviors in group-living species.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  47,10.1002/ecy.3576,abundance;African wild dog;point process model;sociality;spatial capture-recapture;AFRICAN WILD DOG;GROUP-SIZE;DYNAMICS;DENSITY,,

Occupancy models are now widely used to account for false absences in field surveys and to reduce bias in estimates of covariate relationships. Existing occupancy models take as inputs binary detection/non-detection observations of species at each visit to each site. However, autonomous sensing devices and machine learning models are increasingly used to survey biodiversity, generating a new type of observation record (i.e. continuous-score data) that reflects the model's confidence a species is present in each autonomously sensed file, instead of binary detection/non-detection data. These data are not directly compatible with traditional binary occupancy modelling methods. Here, we develop a new occupancy model that models continuous scores on a visit level as a Gaussian mixture, combining a distribution of scores for files that do contain the species of interest and a distribution of scores for files that do not. The model takes as input continuous scores for each autonomously sensed and classified file, along with an optional small number of binary, manually verified detection and non-detection annotations. We present a simulation study that shows that over a range of empirically realistic parameters, our model outperforms traditional occupancy models that are based on binary annotation alone. We also apply this new model to an empirical case study using data generated from five machine learning classifiers applied to autonomous acoustic recordings gathered in the eastern United States. Because our occupancy model generalizes allowable input data beyond binary observations, it is particularly well-suited to the increasing volume of machine learning classified data in ecology and conservation.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  51,10.1111/2041-210X.13905,acoustic recorders;machine learning;occupancy modelling;remote sensing;ESTIMATING SITE OCCUPANCY;SPECIES OCCURRENCE,,

However, when considering movement behaviours to estimate DR is mandatory to include in the formulation the speed ratio, otherwise DR results will be biased. For instance, some wildlife populations present movement patterns characteristic of each behaviour (e.g. foraging or displacement between habitat patches), and further research is needed to integrate the behaviours in the estimation of movement parameters. In this respect, the day range (average daily distance travelled by an individual, DR) is a model parameter that relies on movement and behaviour. This study aims to provide a step forward concerning the use of camera-trapping in movement and behavioural ecology.        We describe a machine learning procedure to differentiate movement behaviours from camera-trap data, and revisit the approach to consider different behaviours in the estimation of DR. Second, working within a simulated framework we tested the performance of three approaches to estimate DR: DROB (i.e. estimating DR without behavioural identification), DRTB (i.e. estimating DR by identifying behaviours manually and weighting each behaviour on the basis of the encounter rate obtained) and DRRB (i.e. estimating DR based on the classification of movement behaviours by a machine learning procedure and the ratio between speeds). Finally, we evaluated these approaches for 24 wild mammal species with different behavioural and ecological traits.        The machine learning procedure to differentiate behaviours showed high accuracy (mean = 0.97). The DROB approach generated accurate results in scenarios with a speed-ratio (fast relative to slow behaviours) lower than 10, and for scenarios in which the animals spend most of the activity period on the slow behaviour. However, when considering movement behaviours to estimate DR is mandatory to include in the formulation the speed ratio, otherwise the DR results will be biased. The new approach, DRRB, generated accurate results in all the scenarios. The results obtained from real populations were consistent with the simulations.        In conclusion, the integration of behaviours and speed-ratio in camera-trap studies makes it possible to obtain unbiased DR. Speed-ratio should be considered so that fast behaviour is not overrepresented. The procedures described in this work extend the applicability of camera-trap-based approaches in both movement and behavioural ecology.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  54,10.1111/2041-210X.13609,activity;machine learning;mammals;REM;simulation;speed;HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;ANIMAL MOVEMENTS;WOLVES,,

Many capture-recapture surveys of wildlife populations operate in continuous time, but detections are typically aggregated into occasions for analysis, even when exact detection times are available. This discards information and introduces subjectivity, in the form of decisions about occasion definition.        2. We develop a spatiotemporal Poisson process model for spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) surveys that operate continuously and record exact detection times. We show that, except in some special cases (including the case in which detection probability does not change within occasion), temporally aggregated data do not provide sufficient statistics for density and related parameters, and that when detection probability is constant over time, our continuous-time (CT) model is equivalent to an existing model based on detection frequencies. We use the model to estimate jaguar density from a camera-trap survey and conduct a simulation study to investigate the properties of a CT estimator and discrete-occasion estimators with various levels of temporal aggregation. This includes investigation of the effect on the estimators of spatiotemporal correlation induced by animal movement.        3. The CT estimator is found to be unbiased and more precise than discrete-occasion estimators based on binary capture data (rather than detection frequencies) when there is no spatiotemporal correlation. It is also found to be only slightly biased when there is correlation induced by animal movement, and to be more robust to inadequate detector spacing, while discrete-occasion estimators with binary data can be sensitive to occasion length, particularly in the presence of inadequate detector spacing.        4. Our model includes as a special case a discrete-occasion estimator based on detection frequencies, and at the same time lays a foundation for the development of more sophisticated CT models and estimators. It allows modelling within-occasion changes in detectability, readily accommodates variation in detector effort, removes subjectivity associated with user-defined occasions and fully utilizes CT data. We identify a need for developing CT methods that incorporate spatiotemporal dependence in detections and see potential for CT models being combined with telemetry-based animal movement models to provide a richer inference framework.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  42     Total Times Cited:  42     Cited Reference Count:  44,10.1111/2041-210X.12196     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),animal movement;data aggregation;density estimation;statistical methods;sufficiency;ESTIMATING POPULATION-SIZE;DENSITY-ESTIMATION;ABUNDANCE;INFERENCE,,

These have been shown to improve species estimates when both datasets are large and dense. However, is a PA dataset that is smaller and patchier than hitherto examined able to do the same? Furthermore, when both datasets are relatively small, is there enough information contained within them to produce a useful estimate of species' distributions? These attributes are common in many applications. A stochastic simulation was conducted to assess the ability of a pooled data SDM to estimate the distribution of species from increasingly sparser and patchier datasets. The simulated datasets were varied by changing the number of presence-absence sample locations, the degree of patchiness of these locations, the number of PO observations, and the level of sampling bias within the PO observations. The performance of the pooled data SDM was compared to a PA SDM and a PO SDM to assess the strengths and limitations of each SDM. The pooled data SDM successfully removed the sampling bias from the PO observations even when the presence-absence data were sparse and patchy, and the PO observations formed the majority of the data. The pooled data SDM was, in general, more accurate and more precise than either the PA SDM or the PO SDM. All SDMs were more precise for the species responses than they were for the covariate coefficients. The emerging SDM methodology that pools PO and PA data will facilitate more certainty around species' distribution estimates, which in turn will allow more relevant and concise management and policy decisions to be enacted.

In this paper, we present a new approach to address this question, using the smoothing function, a method not previously recruited into this ecological context. Using simulation techniques, we explore its accuracy in recovering known species distributions from simulated noisy data, and we compare the smoothing function's predictive abilities to two widely used methods in this field, the generalised linear model (GLM) and random forest machine learning. In studying the smoothing function, we are led to consider a new analytical tool for ecology, which we call the environmental manifold. It is given by the shape of the data cloud of sampled environmental predictor variables, and has deep relevance to ecological niche theory. Hitherto not considered in ecological analyses, it plays a fundamental role in understanding the species-environment relationship, and we utilise it to compare the performance and behaviour of these three methods.        The results of our analysis find both random forest and smoothing to be robust to the complexities of the species-environment relationship, and also, to a degree, the shape of the environmental manifold. In contrast, the GLM's accuracy depends heavily on the complexity of the species-environment relationship, and is also affected by the geometry of the environmental manifold. Furthermore, the smoothing function is seen to be more accurate than random forest in every combination of species-environment relationship and environmental manifold shape, and also less affected by sampling bias. This suggests the promising role that such smoothing functions can have in ecological analyses. Our results also support the robustness of random forest machine learning to nonlinearity in both the species-environment relationship, and for the first time, the complexity of the shape of the environmental manifold. We conclude by discussing the implications and uses of the environmental manifold in ecological practice and theory, including its importance for niche theory, understanding species distributions, and conservation policy.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  49,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101472,Kernel smoothing;Environmental manifold;Random forest machine learning;Species-environment relationship;Predictive modeling;Hutchinsonian niche;ECOLOGY;NICHES,,

In occupancy studies, species misidentification can lead to false-positive detections, which can cause severe estimator biases. Currently, all models that account for false-positive errors only consider omnibus sources of false detections and are limited to single-species occupancy.        2. However, false detections for a given species often occur because of the misidentification with another, closely related species. To exploit this explicit source of false-positive detection error, we develop a two-species occupancy model that accounts for misidentifications between two species of interest. As with other false-positive models, identifiability is greatly improved by the availability of unambiguous detections at a subset of site x occasions. Here, we consider the case where some of the field observations can be confirmed using laboratory or other independent identification methods (""confirmatory data"").        3. We performed three simulation studies to (1) assess the model's performance under various realistic scenarios, (2) investigate the influence of the proportion of confirmatory data on estimator accuracy and (3) compare the performance of this two-species model with that of the single-species false-positive model. The model shows good performance under all scenarios, even when only small proportions of detections are confirmed (e.g. 5%). It also clearly outperforms the single-species model.        4. We illustrate application of this model using a 4-year dataset on two sympatric species of lungless salamanders: the US federally endangered Shenandoah salamander Plethodon shenandoah, and its presumed competitor, the red-backed salamander Plethodon cinereus. Occupancy of red-backed salamanders appeared very stable across the 4 years of study, whereas the Shenandoah salamander displayed substantial turnover in occupancy of forest habitats among years.        5. Given the extent of species misidentification issues in occupancy studies, this modelling approach should help improve the reliability of estimates of species distribution, which is the goal of many studies and monitoring programmes.

Conservation managers rely on accurate estimates of disease parameters, such as pathogen prevalence and infection intensity, to assess disease status of a host population. However, these disease metrics may be biased if low-level infection intensities are missed by sampling methods or laboratory diagnostic tests. These false negatives underestimate pathogen prevalence and overestimate mean infection intensity of infected individuals.        2. Our objectives were two-fold. First, we quantified false negative error rates of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) on non-invasive skin swabs collected from an amphibian community in El Cope, Panama. We swabbed amphibians twice in sequence, and we used a recently developed hierarchical Bayesian estimator to assess disease status of the population. Second, we developed a novel hierarchical Bayesian model to simultaneously account for imperfect pathogen detection from field sampling and laboratory diagnostic testing. We evaluated the performance of the model, using simulations and varying sampling design to quantify the magnitude of bias in estimates of pathogen prevalence and infection intensity.        3. We show that Bd detection probability from skin swabs was related to host infection intensity, where Bd infections <10 zoospores have <95% probability of being detected. If imperfect Bd detection was not considered, then Bd prevalence was underestimated by as much as 71%. In the Bd-amphibian system, this indicates a need to correct for imperfect pathogen detection in enzootic host populations persisting with low-level infections. More generally, our results have implications for study designs in other disease systems, particularly those with similar objectives, biology, and sampling decisions.        4. Uncertainty in pathogen detection is an inherent property of most sampling protocols and diagnostic tests, where the magnitude of bias depends on the study system, type of infection, and false negative error rates. Given that it may be difficult to know this information in advance, we advocate that the most cautious approach is to assume all errors are possible and to accommodate them by adjusting sampling designs. The modelling framework presented here improves the accuracy in estimating pathogen prevalence and infection intensity.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  31     Total Times Cited:  31     Cited Reference Count:  46,10.1111/2041-210X.12868     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),amphibians;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis;chytrid;hierarchical Bayesian model;occupancy model;Panama;BATRACHOCHYTRIUM-DENDROBATIDIS;DIAGNOSTIC-TESTS;AMPHIBIAN CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS;FUNGAL PATHOGEN;CHYTRID FUNGUS;PCR ASSAY;SP-NOV;PREVALENCE;INFECTION;POPULATION;Bias (Epidemiology);Skin,,

For many species, available data consist of ""presence"" data (locations where the species [or evidence of it] has been observed), together with ""background"" data, a random sample of available environmental conditions.        Recently published papers disagree on whether probability of presence is identifiable from such presence-background data alone. This paper aims to resolve the disagreement, demonstrating that additional information is required. We defined seven simulated species representing various simple shapes of response to environmental variables (constant, linear, convex, unimodal, S-shaped) and ran five logistic model-fitting methods using 1000 presence samples and 10 000 background samples; the simulations were repeated 100 times. The experiment revealed a stark contrast between two groups of methods: those based on a strong assumption that species' true probability of presence exactly matches a given parametric form had highly variable predictions and much larger RMS error than methods that take population prevalence (the fraction of sites in which the species is present) as an additional parameter. For six species, the former group grossly under-or overestimated probability of presence. The cause was not model structure or choice of link function, because all methods were logistic with linear and, where necessary, quadratic terms. Rather, the experiment demonstrates that an estimate of prevalence is not just helpful, but is necessary (except in special cases) for identifying probability of presence. We therefore advise against use of methods that rely on the strong assumption, due to Lele and Keim (recently advocated by Royle et al.) and Lancaster and Imbens. The methods are fragile, and their strong assumption is unlikely to be true in practice. We emphasize, however, that we are not arguing against standard statistical methods such as logistic regression, generalized linear models, and so forth, none of which requires the strong assumption.        If probability of presence is required for a given application, there is no panacea for lack of data. Presence-background data must be augmented with an additional datum, e. g., species' prevalence, to reliably estimate absolute (rather than relative) probability of presence.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  99     Total Times Cited:  103     Cited Reference Count:  32,10.1890/12-1520.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),availability;background;identifiability;logistic;measuring use vs. non-use;presence-background;prevalence;resource selection;species distribution model;PRESENCE-ONLY DATA;SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS;LOGISTIC-REGRESSION;HABITAT PREFERENCE;ABSENCE;MODELS;PATTERN;BIAS;Probability,,

Although a key demographic trait determining the spatial dynamics of wild populations, dispersal is notoriously difficult to estimate in the field. Indeed, dispersal distances obtained from the monitoring of marked individuals typically lead to biased estimations of dispersal kernels as a consequence of (i) restricted spatial scale of the study areas compared to species potential dispersal and (ii) heterogeneity in marking and observation efforts and therefore in detection probability across space.        2. Here, we propose a novel method to circumvent these issues that does not require data on observation effort per se, to correct for the variability in detection of marked individuals across space. Observed dispersal events were weighted by the distribution of departure points and an eroded spatial window approach was applied so as to deal with border effect. We conducted a set of simulations which indicated that our method was successful in correcting the effect of spatially heterogeneous detectability and produce unbiased dispersal kernels.        3. We applied this method to a real dataset on the Montagu's harrier (> 5,000 chicks tagged), providing c. 6,000 resightings collected in entire France by a network of 1,200 volunteers within a citizen-science programme. The median dispersal distance observed was 32 km (range: 0.1-627 km). Once corrected for spatial heterogeneity in marking and observation efforts and border effect, the modelled dispersal kernel indicated a median dispersal distance of 78-123 km depending on the spatial scale considered (constrained within French borders or not, respectively).        4. Synthesis and applications: The current rise of citizen-science programmes is likely to stretch our estimate of the ecologically relevant spatial scale at which dispersal takes place for many taxa. Our method is particularly suited for such large-scale data that typically suffer from high spatial heterogeneity in marking and observation efforts and offers the possibility to derive unbiased dispersal kernels, a key component for modelling population dynamics and species distribution in a context of environmental change. Currently, our method assumes homogeneity in both habitat and dispersal behaviour across individuals. We discuss, however, how to relax these hypotheses to further investigate the effect of, e.g. local conspecific density or habitat quality on dispersal propensity.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  46,10.1111/2041-210X.12872     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),bias correction;Circus pygargus;citizen science;imperfect detection;Montagu's harrier;NATAL DISPERSAL;HEN HARRIER;POPULATIONS;SURVIVAL;CONSEQUENCES;VERTEBRATES;DISTANCES;FITNESS;BIOLOGY;FRANCE,,

Recently, this metric has been applied to analysis of microbial communities as well. However, as compared to macroscopic communities, sampling of microscopic communities is different. In particular, most microbial communities are studied using sequencing techniques. These techniques have known biases that result in certain taxa being detected more often than others, even if the taxa are present in the sample at equivalent abundances. There are, for example, amplification biases that result in some sequences being amplified more than others. Likewise, differences in genome size across organisms can result in different numbers of reads from different taxa, again resulting in biased detection. A number of bioinformatics methods have been devised to account for biases in sequencing data, allowing for more accurate estimates of relative taxon abundances. However, because the sampling process itself is affected by biased detection, and because sampling (and under-sampling in particular) can influence the shape of the SAD, it is possible that, even when corrected for through re-scaling, detection biases can affect SAD predictions from sequencing data. To test this hypothesis, we construct a simulation model of the sampling process, focusing on biased detection in shotgun sequencing that arises from genome size differences across microbial taxa. Interestingly, we find that, although genome size itself does not impact SAD predictions, predictions can vary depending on the range of genome sizes that are represented in a community, as well as how genome size is distributed (i.e., whether the majority of species have small versus large genomes). Our results suggest that care should be taken when comparing SADs across environments, particularly when those environments might have taxa with different genome size distributions. Furthermore, our results indicate that relatively deep sequencing might be required to avoid drawing spurious inferences about ecological differences across microbial communities.

Often, these approaches make use of at least one presence-only dataset and use the log-likelihood of an inhomogeneous Poisson point process model in the combined likelihood construction. While these advancements have been shown to improve predictive performance, they do not currently address challenges in presence-only modelling such as checking and correcting for violations of the independence assumption of a Poisson point process model or more general challenges in species distribution modelling such as overfitting. In this paper, we present an extension of the combined likelihood framework which accommodates alternative presence-only likelihoods in the presence of spatial dependence as well as lasso-type penalties to account for potential overfitting. We compare the proposed combined penalized likelihood approach to the standard combined likelihood approach via simulation and apply the method to modelling the distribution of the Eurasian lynx in the Jura Mountains in eastern France. The simulations show that the proposed combined penalized likelihood approach has better predictive performance than the standard approach when spatial dependence is present in the data. The lynx analysis shows that the predicted maps vary significantly between the model fitted with the proposed combined penalized approach accounting for spatial dependence and the model fitted with the standard combined likelihood.

This was done by combining the best available information from observations and chemical transport models. Specifically, by (1) incorporating PM10 surface daily concentrations and model results from the CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) ensemble; and (2) spreading the forecast corrections from the observation locations to the entire gridded domain covered by model forecasts by means of a data regularization approach. Results were verified against independent PM10 observations measured at 169 stations by local Environmental Protection Agencies. Twelve months of observations were matched in time and space, from January to December 2017, with air pollution model results. The studied domain encompassed the Po Valley, one of the most polluted areas in Europe, and that still does not meet the air quality criteria for the annual average concentration and the maximum number of exceedances allowed for the particulate matter.        Raw model data were found to be affected by a bias with a strong seasonal dependency: a large negative bias in winter and a small bias in the summer months. The data assimilation approach, embedded into a Bayesian hierarchical approach, was able to drastically reduce the bias. Furthermore, an advanced computational approach, based on the variational Bayes method coupled with the minimization of the Kullback Leibler divergence to approximate the optimal solution, made it possible to cost-effectively assimilate data throughout the period under consideration. By using stratified cross-validation to test the accuracy of our predictions, we found high out-of-sample R-2 ( = 0.83) and an average decrease of about two-thirds of the root mean square error.        Assimilated data were used to produce daily resolved cumulative population exposures. The Po Valley, in relation to the interim targets (ITs) defined by the World Health Organization, accomplishes the IT-2 level, that is to say that the average annual concentration is lower than 50 mu g/m(3), but it is still very far from the IT-3 level, corresponding to an average annual concentration of less than 30 mu g/m(3). Moreover, most of the Po Valley still has a high number of days in which the average daily concentration is higher than 50 mu g/m(3), well above the maximum limit of 35 days established by European and Italian legislation.

Binomial N-mixture models are commonly applied to analyse population survey data. By estimating detection probabilities, N-mixture models aim at extracting information about abundances in terms of absolute and not just relative numbers. This separation of detection probability and abundance relies on parametric assumptions about the distribution of individuals among sites and of detections of individuals among repeat visits to sites. Current methods for checking assumptions are limited, and their computational complexity has hindered evaluations of their performance.        2. We use simulations and a case study to assess the sensitivity of binomial N-mixture models to overdispersion in abundance and in detection, develop computationally efficient graphical goodness of fit checks to detect it, and evaluate the ability of the checks to identify overdispersion.        3. The simulations show that if the parametric assumptions are not exact the bias in estimated abundances can be severe: underestimation if there is overdispersion in abundance relative to the fitted model and overestimation if there is overdispersion in detection. Our goodness-of-fit checks performed well in detecting lack of fit when the abundance distribution was overdispersed, but struggled to detect lack of fit when detections were overdispersed. We show that the inability to detect lack of fit due to overdispersed detection is caused by a fundamental similarity between N-mixture models with beta-binomial detections and N-mixture models with negative binomial abundances.        4. The strong biases that can occur in the binomial N-mixture model when the distribution of individuals among sites, or the detection model, is mis-specified implies that checking goodness of fit is essential for sound inference about abundance. To check the assumptions we provide computationally efficient goodness of fit checks that are available in an R-package nmixgof. However, even when a binomial N-mixture model appears to fit the data well, estimates are not robust in the presence of overdispersion. We show that problems can occur even when estimated detection probabilities are high, and that previously reported problems with negative binomial models cannot always be diagnosed by checking the sensitivity of abundance estimates to numerical cutoff values used in likelihood computations.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  30     Total Times Cited:  30     Cited Reference Count:  31,10.1111/2041-210X.13062     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),abundance;beta-binomial;binomial;N-mixture model;negative binomial;overdispersion;Poisson;population survey;HIERARCHICAL-MODELS;COUNT DATA;ABUNDANCE;DIAGNOSTICS,,

To collect data over large spatial and temporal extents for such inferences, especially for species with low densities or wide distributions, citizen science can be an efficient approach. Integrated models have also emerged as an important methodology to estimate population parameters by combining multiple types of data, including citizen science data. We developed a spatially explicit integrated model that combines opportunistically collected presence-absence (PA) data, commonly collected in citizen science efforts, with systematically collected spatial capture-recapture (SCR) data, which are often limited to small spatial and temporal extents. We conducted single and multi-season simulations with parameters informed by North American black bear (Ursus americanus) populations, to evaluate the influence of varying amounts of opportunistic PA data collected at larger spatial and temporal extents on the estimation of population-level parameters. Integrating opportunistic PA data increased the precision and accuracy of posterior estimates of abundance, and survival and recruitment rates. In some cases, adding PA locations improved abundance estimates more than increasing PA detection probability. Posterior estimates were as precise and unbiased as when higher quality, but sparse, SCR data were available. We also applied the integrated model to SCR and citizen science PA data collected on black bears in New York, with results consistent with our simulations.

However, detailed mapping of trees for large areas is not feasible with current technologies, but statistical methods for matching the forest plot data with biophysical characteristics of the landscape offer a practical means to populate landscapes with a limited set of forest plot inventory data. We used a modified random forests approach with Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE) vegetation and biophysical predictors to impute plot data collected by the US Forest Service's Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) to the landscape at 30-m grid resolution. This method imputes the plot with the best statistical match, according to a ""forest"" of decision trees, to each pixel of gridded landscape data. In this work, we used the LANDFIRE data set for gridded input because it is publicly available, offers seamless coverage of variables needed for fire models, and is consistent with other data sets, including burn probabilities and flame length probabilities generated for the continental United States. The main output of this project is a map of imputed plot identifiers at 30 x 30 m spatial resolution for the western United States that can be linked to the FIA databases to produce tree-level maps or to map other plot attributes. In addition, we used the imputed inventory data to generate maps of forest cover, forest height, and vegetation group at 30 x 30 m resolution for all forested pixels in the western United States, as a means of assessing the accuracy of our methodology.

The presence-only data for organisms is usually assumed to be obtained randomly from the region of interest; however, it is often the case that it is biased toward the areas easily accessed and adversely affects prediction accuracy. To address this sampling bias problem relevant to the prediction accuracy and model fitting of habitat distributions, we propose a new Poisson point process (PPP) model named as a quasi PPP, where environmental effect and sampling bias are explicitly modeled in separate clusters in a framework of quasi-linear modeling. The quasi-linear modeling is designed for capturing homogeneity within clusters and heterogeneity between clusters to improve the estimation accuracy of species distribution. The proposed model includes conventional models such as thinned and superposed PPPs as special cases. We have found that the quasi PPP outperforms the other existing methods in terms of goodness of model fitting. A statistical index based on the quasi-linear modeling is proposed to measure how the presence-only data used for the estimation of the species habitat distribution is affected by the sampling bias. The utility of the quasi PPP has been illustrated using simulation studies as well as the comprehensive vascular plant data in Japan. Our proposed model flexibly incorporates the effect of sampling biases to improve the estimation accuracy of species distributions.

For instance, the elements of metacommunity structure (EMS) framework uses species occurrence data to classify metacommunity structure and link it to underlying environmental gradients. While the efficacy of this approach relies on the quality of the data, few studies have considered how imperfect detection, which is widespread in ecological surveys and the major focus of occupancy modeling, affects the outcome. We introduce a framework that integrates multispecies occupancy models with the current EMS framework, detection error-corrected EMS (DECEMS). This method offers two distinct advantages. First, DECEMS reduces bias in characterizing metacommunity structure by using repeated surveys and occupancy models to disentangle species-specific occupancy and detection probabilities, ultimately bringing metacommunity structure classification into a more probabilistic framework. Second, occupancy modeling allows estimation of species-specific responses to environmental covariates, which will increase our ability to link species-level effects to metacommunity-wide patterns. After reviewing the EMS framework, we introduce a simple multispecies occupancy model and show how DECEMS can work in practice, highlighting that detection error often causes EMS to assign incorrect structures. To emphasize the broader applicability of this approach, we further illustrate that DECEMS can reduce the rate of structure misclassification by more than 20% in some cases, even proving useful when detection error rates are quite low (similar to 10%). Integrating occupancy models and the EMS framework will lead to more accurate descriptions of metacommunity structure and to a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which different structures arise.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  23     Cited Reference Count:  34,10.1890/14-1580.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bayesian inference;Bayesian models;community structure;detection error;metacommunity ecology;occupancy models;simulation;COMMUNITY;FRAMEWORK,,

Statistical analysis of these data is complicated by spatial bias in sampling and temporal variability in detection conditions. Advanced methods for analysis of these data are required but are currently underdeveloped. We propose a state-space model (SSM) for observation network data to estimate detailed movements of individual animals. The underlying movement model is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, which is stationary, and therefore has an inherent mechanism that models home range behaviour. An integral part of the approach is the detection function, which models the probability of logging animal presences. The detection function is also used to provide absence information when animals are undetected. Since the ability to detect an animal often depends on time-varying external factors such as environmental conditions, we use covariate information about detection efficiency as control variables. Via simulation, we found that movement estimation error scales log-linearly with network sparsity. This result can be used to indicate the number of stations necessary to achieve a desired upper bound on estimation error. Furthermore, we found that the SSM outperforms existing techniques in terms of estimating detailed movements and that estimates are robust towards mis-specification of the detection function. We also tested the importance of accounting for time-varying detection conditions and found that the probability of making wrong conclusions decreases substantially when covariate information is exploited. The model is used to estimate movements and home range of a humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus) at Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific Ocean. Here, detection conditions have a strong diel component, which is controlled for using detection efficiency information from a reference device. The presented approach enhances the toolbox for analysis of observation network data as collected by acoustic telemetry or potentially other aspiring methods such as camera trapping and mobile phone tagging. By explicitly modelling movement and observation processes, the model integrates all sources of uncertainty and provides a sound statistical basis for making well-informed management decisions from imperfect information.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  28     Cited Reference Count:  24,10.1111/2041-210X.12086     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),acoustic telemetry;detection probability;Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process;state-space model;MARK-RECAPTURE DATA;ACOUSTIC TRACKING;MODELS;TELEMETRY;BEHAVIOR;DESIGN;ARRAY;HOME;Animal Shells;Animals,,

Ring-recovery data can be used to obtain estimates of survival probability which is a key demographic parameter of interest for wild animal populations. Conditional modelling of ring-recovery data is needed when cohort numbers are unavailable or unreliable. It is often necessary to include in such analysis a recovery probability that is declining as a function of time, and failure to do this can result in biased estimates of annual survival. 2. Corresponding estimates of survival probability need to be reliable in order for correct conclusions to be drawn regarding the effects of climate change. 3. We show that standard logistic modelling of a decline in recovery probability is unsatisfactory, and propose and investigate a range of alternative procedures. 4. Methods are illustrated by application to a recovery data set on grey herons. The model selected is a scaled-logistic model, and it is shown to provide a unifying analysis of several data sets collected on different common bird species. The model makes specific predictions, providing potential new insights and avenues for ecological research. The wider performance of this model is evaluated through simulation. 5. In this study, we propose a new scaled-logistic model for the analysis of ring-recovery data without cohort numbers, which incorporates a reporting probability that declines over time. The model is shown to perform well in simulation studies and for both a single real data set and several real data sets in combination.

Although a variety of approaches to obtain unbiased estimators are available, these usually require the formulation of an explicit (parametric) model for the error-prone variable and a latent model for the unobserved (latent) error-free variable. In practice, this is often difficult. We propose to generalize the simulation extrapolation (SIMEX) technique, a heuristic approach to correct for measurement error, to situations where it is difficult to explicitly formulate an error model or latent model for a variable of interest. We illustrate the idea with the example of error in pedigrees. Pedigree error causes error in estimates of inbreeding coefficients and the relatedness matrix, thus biasing estimates of inbreeding depression or heritability. Instead of formulating error models for inbreeding coefficients or the relatedness matrix, we directly apply the SIMEX idea to the pedigree. The initially known error proportion in the pedigree is progressively increased, all models are refitted, and the observed trend in the quantities of interest is extrapolated back to a hypothetical error-free pedigree to obtain bias-corrected estimates. We tested this pedigree-SIMEX (PSIMEX) method with simulated pedigrees and with data from a free-living population of song sparrows. The simulation study indicates that the PSIMEX estimator is almost unbiased for inbreeding depression and heritability, and that it has a much lower mean squared error (MSE) than the naive estimator. In the application to the song sparrows, the error-corrected results could be validated against the actual values thanks to the availability of both an error-prone and an error-free pedigree. The results indicate that bias and MSE are reduced by PSIMEX. For easy accessibility of the method, we provide the R-package PSIMEX. By transferring the SIMEX philosophy to error in pedigrees, we have illustrated how this heuristic approach can be generalized to situations where explicit error models are difficult to formulate. Thanks to the simplicity of the idea, many other error problems in ecology and evolution might be amenable to SIMEX-like error correction methods.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  74,10.1111/2041-210X.13255,heritability;inbreeding coefficient;inbreeding depression;misassigned paternities;pedigree reconstruction;relatedness;SIMEX;uncertainty;EXTRA-PAIR PATERNITY;INBREEDING DEPRESSION;GENETIC-PARAMETERS;MODELS;HERITABILITY;INFERENCE;MAGNITUDE;PHENOTYPE;LOCATION,,

We demonstrate the utility of simulation methods for home range analysis planning by comparing bias arising from three home range estimation methods under multiple detection scenarios.

Home range estimates were less biased by reduced detection probability when sampling effort was increased, but the effects of sampling day distribution were minimal. Like others, we found that kernel density estimates were the least affected by variation in detection probability, while minimum convex polygons were most affected.

Here, we elaborate on recent methodological advances to build a spatially explicit multi-state capture-recapture model to study natal dispersal in a territorial mammal while accounting for imperfect detection and movement in and out of the study area. We validate our model using a simulation study where we compare it to a non-spatial multi-state capture-recapture model.

By contrast, the non-spatial multi-state estimates underestimated both survival and natal dispersal even for short dispersal distances relative to the study area size. We discuss the application of our approach to other species and monitoring setups. We estimated higher inheritance probabilities of female Alpine marmots, which suggests higher levels of philopatry, although the probability to become dominant after dispersal did not differ between sexes. Nonetheless, the lower survival of young adult males suggests higher costs of dispersal for males.

We evaluate this with a cellular automata model designed to replicate different fire regimes with identical fire rotations but different fire frequencies and patchiness. Our results indicate that high frequency patch burning can be identified in tree-ring records at relatively modest sampling intensities. However, standard methods that filter out fires represented by few trees systematically biases the records against patch burning. In simulated fire regime shifts, fading records, sample size, and the contrast between the shifted fire regimes all interact to make statistical identification of regime shifts challenging without other information.

Our objective was to assess effect of an ad hoc (h_ad hoc) smoothing parameter in kernel analysis from two species that were predicted to have different patterns of utilization distributions across a range of sample sizes. We evaluated variation in homerange estimates with location data collected from GPS collars on two species: mule deer Odocoileus hemionus and coyotes Canis latrans. We calculated home ranges using 95% and 50% kernel contours using reference (h_ref) and h_ad hoc smoothing parameters. To evaluate the influence of sample size, we calculated home ranges using both smoothing parameters for random subsamples of 5, 10, 25 and 50% of GPS locations and compared area estimates to estimates for 100% of GPS locations. On mule deer, we also conducted visual relocations using conventional radiotelemetry, which resulted in fewer locations than GPS collars. Area was overestimated at smaller sample sizes, but an interesting pattern was noted with higher relative bias at 60-100 locations than at sample sizes < 50 locations. Relative bias was most likely due to increased smoothing of outer data points. Subsampling allowed us to examine relative bias across a range of samples sizes for the two smoothing parameters. Minimum number of points to obtain a consistent home range estimates varied by smoothing method, species, study duration, and volume contour (95% or 50%). While h_ad hoc performed consistently better over most sample sizes, there may not be a universal recommendation for all studies and species.

Identifying consistent differences across stratified populations can allow us to detect genomic regions under selection and that differ between populations with different histories or attributes. Current popular statistical tests are easily implemented in widely available software tools which make them simple for researchers to apply. However, there are potential problems with the way such tests are used, which means that underlying assumptions about the data are frequently violated. These problems are highlighted by simulation of simple but realistic population genetic models of neutral evolution and the performance of different tests are assessed. We present alternative tests (including Generalised Linear Models [GLMs] with quasibinomial error structure) with attractive properties for the analysis of allele frequency differences and re-analyse a published dataset. The simulations show that common statistical tests for consistent allele frequency differences perform poorly, with high false positive rates. Applying tests that do not confound heterogeneity and main effects significantly improves inference. Variation in sequencing coverage likely produces many false positives and re-scaling allele frequencies to counts out of a common value or an effective sample size reduces this effect. Many researchers are interested in identifying allele frequencies that vary consistently across replicates to identify loci underlying phenotypic responses to selection or natural variation in phenotypes. Popular methods that have been suggested for this task perform poorly in simulations. Overall, quasibinomial GLMs perform better and also have the attractive feature of allowing correction for multiple testing by standard procedures and are easily extended to other designs.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  24     Total Times Cited:  24     Cited Reference Count:  57,10.1111/2041-210X.12810     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),allele frequency differences;CMH-test;experimental evolution;pool-seq;quasibinomial GLM;selection;SPONTANEOUS MUTATION-RATE;POOLED DNA SAMPLES;DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER;POLYMORPHISM DATA;NEXT-GENERATION;ADAPTATION;DIFFERENTIATION;NUCLEOTIDE;INFERENCE;SEQ;Alleles;Gene Frequency,,

The global one-factor-at-a-time (OAT) method of Morris was used for sensitivity analysis of streamflow, combined nitrate (NO3) and nitrite (NO2) fluxes, and total phosphorous (TP) at five gage stations in a primarily agricultural watershed in the Midwestern United States. The Morris method was analyzed for 36 combinations of informal likelihood functions, gage stations, and SWAT model output responses, including relative error mass balance (BIAS), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient, and root mean square error (RMSE) for peak and low fluxes, and one formal likelihood function that aggregates information content from multiple sites and multiple variables using 65 SWAT parameters. The correlation between sensitivity measures from different likelihood functions was also assessed using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Sensitivity of parameters using different likelihood functions was highly variable, although sensitivity of streamflow and TP showed a high correlation. A stronger correlation between sensitivity of nutrient fluxes at the upstream stations as well as the stations closer to the watershed outlets was evident. Comparison of the combined rank of parameters from informal likelihood functions and the ranks obtained from the formal likelihood function confirmed formal likelihood function ability to effectively identify both sensitive and insensitive parameters with less computational and analysis burden. Uncertainty analysis of the Morris results using bootstrap replications showed that both formal and informal likelihood functions identified sensitive parameters with high confidence.

Advances in noninvasive genetic sampling have fueled an increase in the use of noninvasive genetic sampling-based capture-recapture. However, when working with free-ranging populations of unknown size, managers often lack data necessary to select the appropriate estimator. This leads to uncertainty regarding how choice of estimator or sampling design influence estimates, and managers may select estimators based on funding or logistical constraints. Alternatively, comparing estimates from multiple estimators can provide managers with greater confidence in estimates, or highlight potential differences. We used noninvasive genetic sampling to estimate the abundance of free-ranging kit foxes Vulpes macrotis and coyotes Canis latrans. We generated estimates of abundance with two non-spatial likelihood-based estimators: 1) robust design Huggins capture-recapture models and 2) single-occasion capture with replacement (CAPWIRE) models. We compared these with recently published estimates derived from spatially explicit capturere-capture (SECR) models. For both species, estimates from Huggins models were generally lower than those from SECR. Abundance estimates from CAPWIRE, which was developed specifically for noninvasive genetic sampling and generates estimates from a single sampling occasion, tended to be biased low with high precision. Our results suggest that choice of estimator and sampling design can significantly influence estimates, and that the relationship between estimators varied between species. Our results further suggest that single-occasion sampling often employed with CAPWIRE abundance estimation may produce biased results and be inappropriate for species requiring dispersed sampling strategies.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  49,10.2981/wlb.00534     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),abundance;Canis latrans;capture-recapture;CAPWIRE;noninvasive genetic sampling;Vulpes macrotis;ESTIMATING POPULATION-SIZE;CAPTURE-RECAPTURE METHODS;MARK;IDENTIFICATION;RELIABILITY;GENOTYPES;DENSITY;QUALITY,,

Methods for estimating survival probability from field data typically require marking individuals, but marking methods are not possible for arthropod species that molt their exoskeleton between life stages. We developed a novel Bayesian state-space model to estimate arthropod larval survival probability from stage-structured count data. We performed simulation studies to evaluate estimation bias due to detection probability, individual variation in stage duration, and study design (sampling frequency and sample size). Estimation of cumulative survival probability from oviposition to pupation was robust to potential sources of bias. Our simulations also provide guidance for designing field studies with minimal bias. We applied the model to the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), a declining species in North America for which conservation programs are being implemented. We estimated cumulative survival from egg to pupation from monarch counts conducted at 18 field sites in three landcover types in Iowa, USA, and Ontario, Canada: road right-of-ways, natural habitats (gardens and restored meadows), and agricultural field borders. Mean predicted survival probability across all landcover types was 0.014 (95% CI: 0.004-0.024), four times lower than previously published estimates using an ad hoc estimator. Estimated survival probability ranged from 0.002 (95% CI: 7.0E-7 to 0.034) to 0.058 (95% CI: 0.013-0.113) at individual sites. Among landcover types, agricultural field borders in Ontario had the highest estimated survival probability (0.025 with 95% CI: 0.008-0.043) and natural areas had the lowest estimated survival probability (0.008 with 95% CI: 0.009-0.024).

Discrete-time hidden Markov models (HMMs) have become an immensely popular tool for inferring latent animal behaviours from telemetry data. While movement HMMs typically rely solely on location data (e.g. step length and turning angle), auxiliary biotelemetry and environmental data are powerful and readily-available resources for incorporating much more ecological and behavioural realism. However, complex movement or observation process models often necessitate custom and computationally demanding HMM model-fitting techniques that are impractical for most practitioners, and there is a paucity of generalized user-friendly software available for implementing multivariate HMMs of animal movement.        2. Here, we introduce an open-source R package, momentuHMM, that addresses many of the deficiencies in existing HMM software. Features include: (1) data pre-processing and visualization; (2) user-specified probability distributions for an unlimited number of data streams and latent behaviour states; (3) biased and correlated random walk movement models, including dynamic ""activity centres"" associated with attractive or repulsive forces; (4) user-specified design matrices and constraints for covariate modelling of parameters using formulas familiar to most R users; (5) multiple imputation methods that account for measurement error and temporally irregular or missing data; (6) seamless integration of spatio-temporal covariate raster data; (7) cosinor and spline models for cyclical and other complicated patterns; (8) model checking and selection; and (9) simulation.        3. After providing an overview of the main features of the package, we demonstrate some of the capabilities of momentuHMM using real-world examples. These include models for cyclical movement patterns of African elephants, foraging trips of northern fur seals, loggerhead turtle movements relative to ocean surface currents, and grey seal movements among three activity centres.        4. momentuHMM considerably extends the capabilities of existing HMM software while accounting for common challenges associated with telemetry data. It therefore facilitates more realistic hypothesis-driven animal movement analyses that have hitherto been largely inaccessible to non-statisticians. While motivated by telemetry data, the package can be used for analysing any type of data that is amenable to HMMs. Practitioners interested in additional features are encouraged to contact the authors.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  103     Total Times Cited:  104     Cited Reference Count:  25,10.1111/2041-210X.12995     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),biologging;biotelemetry;crawl;moveHMM;state-space model;state-switching;BEHAVIORAL STATES;TELEMETRY DATA;RANDOM-WALKS;Animals;Animal Shells,,

We argue that this endeavor will benefit from the development and use of meaningful basic models against which to compare more complex models.

The analysis of recently diverged, hyper-rich invertebrate groups provides an opportunity to investigate latitudinal patterns with the statistical power of large trees while minimizing potentially confounding variation in ecology and history. Here, we synthesize global phylogenetic and macroecological data on a hyperdiverse (> 1,100 species) ant radiation, Pheidole and test predictions of three general explanations for the latitudinal gradient: variation in diversification rates, tropical conservatism and ecological regulation. Location Global. Time period The past 35 million years. Major taxa studied The hyperdiverse ant genus Pheidole Westwood. Methods We assembled geographic data for 1,499 species and morphospecies, and inferred a dated phylogeny for 449 species of Pheidole, including 167 species newly sequenced for this study. We tested for correlations between diversification rate and latitude with Bayesian analysis of macroevolutionary mixtures (BAMM), hidden state speciation and extinction (HiSSE), geographic state speciation and extinction (GeoSSE), and a non-parametric method (FiSSE), evaluated evidence for richness steady state, and examined patterns of diversification as Pheidole spread around the globe. Results There was no evidence of systematic variation of net diversification rates with latitude across any of the methods. We found that Pheidole diversification occurred in bursts when new continents were colonized, followed by a slowdown in each region, but there is no evidence richness has saturated at an equilibrium in any region. Additionally, we found latitudinal affinity is moderately conserved with a Neotropical ancestor and simulations show that phylogenetic inertia alone is sufficient to produce the gradient pattern. Main conclusions Our results provide no evidence that diversification rates vary systematically with latitude. Richness is far from steady state in each region, contrary to the ecological regulation hypothesis, although there is evidence that ecological opportunity promotes diversification after colonization of new areas. The fact that niche conservatism is strong enough to produce the gradient pattern is in accord with the tropical conservatism hypothesis. Overall, these results shed light on the mechanisms underlying the emergence of the diversity gradient within the past 34 million years, complementing recent work on deeper time-scales, and more generally contribute toward much-needed invertebrate perspective on global biodiversity dynamics.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  23     Cited Reference Count:  76,10.1111/geb.12867     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ants;diversification rate;diversity regulation;latitudinal diversity gradient;macroevolution;tropical conservatism;SPECIES-RICHNESS;NICHE CONSERVATISM;GEOGRAPHIC-DISTRIBUTION;PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL;RANGE EVOLUTION;GLOBAL PATTERNS;R PACKAGE;DIVERSIFICATION;SPECIATION;MODELS,,

Common approaches to estimating density of avian populations often either ignore the probability that an individual is present within the sampling area but is not available to be sampled (e.g., not vocalizing), or do not consider covariates that could influence availability. Additionally, management decisions made at the management unit scale are often informed by inadequate monitoring practices, such as limited sampling intensity. In such cases, management agencies calculate density by applying correction factors (e.g., detection probabilities estimated using empirical data from a different study system) to count data, rather than estimating a detection function directly using statistical models. We conducted a simulation study using northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; bobwhite) as a model species to quantify the consequences of mis-specifying avian point count models on bias and precision of density estimates. We compared bias and precision of estimates from a fully specified distance-sampling model that estimates availability and detection to 4 different mis-specified approaches, including 2 approaches to calculating density using correction factors. Using correction factors to calculate density produced estimates with low bias but relatively lower precision compared to the fully specified model (CV of density estimates at 35 sites over 5 years: fully specified = 10%, correction factors = 25% and 30%). Although the mean precision and bias of the fully specified model improved with more data (70 sites over 5 years, CV = 9%; 35 sites over 10 years, CV = 9%), precision of correction factors did not (70 sites over 5 years, CV = 22% and 27%; 35 sites over 10 years, CV = 24% and 29%). The fully specified model captured the underlying temporal variation in detection and availability. Increasing sampling duration from 5 to 10 years improved modeled estimates of growth rate, even for mis-specified models, but not derived growth rates using pre-determined detection functions. We demonstrated that conducting point counts 3 times/year at a feasible number of sites can produce relatively unbiased estimates of bobwhite density. Pre-determined detection functions can be fortuitously unbiased for certain years, but they are not a reliable method for determining density or identifying trends in density over time.

In particular, population assessment via conventional distance sampling (CDS) at landscape scales is challenging and often discarded for its high costs. The development of a framework for its methodological optimization is mandatory. To tackle this issue, we used survey simulations. For arbitrary-distributed populations, we compared the following: (i) systematic random transect allocation, (ii) random selection of footpaths, and (iii) two-stage sampling selection of footpaths (2, 5, 10 blocks). The performance of two-stage sampling and random footpath selection estimators was similar. Then, we applied previous results to estimate the size of a red deer (Cervus elaphus) population in the Italian Apennines. Using data from a pilot survey, we estimated density via CDS and density surface modeling (DSM), and we quantified survey costs per unit effort. Considering our deer distribution, we finally simulated and evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the abovementioned designs for a range of realistic efforts (25-65 transects). CDS produced a negatively biased and less precise estimate than the corresponding DSM. For an effort of 65 transects, design (ii) estimates were unbiased (coefficient of variation= 0.31), while design (iii) provided negatively biased estimates (coefficient of variation= 0.27). Two-stage sampling designs with few blocks were less expensive than other designs in attaining the same level of precision, and they emerged as a cost-effective survey design. Our simulation approach thus provided managers a readily available tool to improve the estimate of ungulate abundances at a landscape scale.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  48,10.1007/s10344-014-0898-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Density estimation;Density surface modeling;Red deer;Sampling design;Survey simulations;Two-stage sampling;SPATIAL MODELS;FALLOW DEER;ABUNDANCE;DENSITY;AERIAL;DESIGN;Cost-Benefit Analysis,,

The decision by an animal near a road to either cross or not cross may be influenced by characteristics of the road, environmental conditions, traits of the individual animal, and other aspects of the context within which the decision is made. We considered such factors in a mixed-effects logistic regression model describing the nightly road crossing probabilities of invasive nocturnal Brown Treesnakes (Boiga irregularis) through short-term radiotracking of 691 snakes within close proximity to 50 road segments across the island of Guam. All measures of road magnitude (traffic volume, gap width, surface type, etc.) were significantly negatively correlated with crossing probabilities. Snake body size was the only intrinsic factor associated with crossing rates, with larger snakes crossing roads more frequently. Humidity was the only environmental variable affecting crossing rate. The distance of the snake from the road at the start of nightly movement trials was the most significant predictor of crossings. The presence of snake traps with live mouse lures during a portion of the trials indicated that localized prey cues reduced the probability of a snake crossing the road away from the traps, suggesting that a snake's decision to cross roads is influenced by local foraging opportunities. Per capita road crossing rates of Brown Treesnakes were very low, and comparisons to historical records suggest that crossing rates have declined in the 60+ yr since introduction to Guam. We report a simplified model that will allow managers to predict road crossing rates based on snake, road, and contextual characteristics. Road crossing simulations based on actual snake size distributions demonstrate that populations with size distributions skewed toward larger snakes will result in a higher number of road crossings. Our method of modeling per capita road crossing probabilities as a binary response variable, influenced by contextual factors, may be useful for describing or predicting road crossings by individuals of other taxa provided that appropriate spatial and temporal resolution can be achieved and that potentially influential covariate data can be obtained.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  98,10.1002/ecs2.1292     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),animal behavior;Boiga irregularis;Guam;invasive species;mixed effects logistic regression;movement ecology;radiotelemetry;road crossing avoidance;road ecology;TREESNAKES BOIGA-IRREGULARIS;BROWN TREE SNAKE;MALE-BIASED DISPERSAL;HOME-RANGE SIZE;HABITAT USE;BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES;EASTERN MASSASAUGA;SPATIAL ECOLOGY;STEGONOTUS-CUCULLATUS;REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY,,

Here, we introduce MInOSSE (massively interpolated occurrences for species spatial estimation), a model-based method that combines a machine learning algorithm and geostatistical approaches to reconstruct a target fossil species' geographic ranges by relying on the distribution of other coeval species and without using environmental predictors. We tested MInOSSE by using many simulated fossil species' distributions, comparing its performance with MCP and Alpha-Hull outcomes and applying it to real case studies. In all simulations, MInOSSE outperformed the competing methods. Interestingly, the superior performance of MInOSSE becomes more apparent when the fossil record of the target species is scarce, that is, when appropriate range reconstruction is most problematic with polygon-based methods.

Although large numbers of populations and models (i.e. scenarios) can be analysed with ABC using molecular data obtained from various marker types, methodological and computational issues arise when these numbers become too large. Moreover, Robert et similar to al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 2011, 108, 15112) have shown that the conclusions drawn on ABC model comparison cannot be trusted per se and required additional simulation analyses. Monte Carlo inferential techniques to empirically evaluate confidence in scenario choice are very time-consuming, however, when the numbers of summary statistics (Ss) and scenarios are large. We here describe a methodological innovation to process efficient ABC scenario probability computation using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on Ss before computing logistic regression. We used simulated pseudo-observed data sets (pods) to assess the main features of the method (precision and computation time) in comparison with traditional probability estimation using raw (i.e. not LDA transformed) Ss. We also illustrate the method on real microsatellite data sets produced to make inferences about the invasion routes of the coccinelid Harmonia axyridis. We found that scenario probabilities computed from LDA-transformed and raw Ss were strongly correlated. Type I and II errors were similar for both methods. The faster probability computation that we observed (speed gain around a factor of 100 for LDA-transformed Ss) substantially increases the ability of ABC practitioners to analyse large numbers of pods and hence provides a manageable way to empirically evaluate the power available to discriminate among a large set of complex scenarios.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  78     Total Times Cited:  78     Cited Reference Count:  39,10.1111/j.1755-0998.2012.03153.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Approximate Bayesian Computation;coalescence;discriminant analysis;evolutionary scenario;model probability;molecular markers;population genetics;LIKELIHOOD-FREE INFERENCE;POPULATION HISTORY;SELECTION;INVASION;ORIGIN;ABC;Probability;Discrimination (Psychology);Discriminant Analysis,,

In contrast, macroevolutionary studies performed by neontologists have mostly focused on morphometric traits. Although these data types are very different, some studies have suggested that they capture common patterns. Nonetheless, the tests employed to support this claim have not explicitly incorporated a phylogenetic framework and may therefore be susceptible to confounding effects due to the presence of common phylogenetic structure. We address this question using the scorpion genus Brachistosternus Pocock 1893 as case study. We make use of a time-calibrated multilocus molecular phylogeny, and compile discrete and traditional morphometric data sets, both capturing the overall morphology of the organisms. We find that morphospaces derived from these matrices are significantly different, and that the degree of discordance cannot be replicated by simulations of random character evolution. Moreover, we find strong support for contrasting modes of evolution, with discrete characters being congruent with an early burst' scenario whereas morphometric traits suggest species-specific adaptations to have driven morphological evolution. The inferred macroevolutionary dynamics are therefore contingent on the choice of character type. Finally, we confirm that metrics of correlation fail to detect these profound differences given common phylogenetic structure in both data sets, and that methods incorporating a phylogenetic framework and accounting for expected covariance should be favoured.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  69,10.1111/jeb.13050     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),disparity;macroevolution;morphometrics;morphospace;phylogenetic comparative methods;BOTHRIURID SCORPION;MORPHOLOGICAL EVOLUTION;DISPARITY;DIVERSIFICATION;RADIATION;GENUS;CONVERGENCE;PHYLOGENY;DIVERSITY;SHAPE;Scorpions;Scorpion Stings,,

However, quantifying plant species richness in the tropics is potentially time-consuming because of high species diversity. Plant species richness estimates are also frequently biased, because many rare species are not detected. To address these problems, the use of a variable area method has been proposed as an alternative to fixed area methods, but its applicability to plants with aggregated distributions has been questioned based on simulation studies. We use empirical data to compare the efficiency and accuracy of a variable area method and a fixed area method for estimating species richness, density and basal area for plants with aggregated distributions, using palms as a model taxon.        Methods        Adult palms were sampled in twenty 10 x 30 m transects in an Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. All individuals were considered in the fixed area method, while in the variable area method only the first six adults in each transect were sampled; in this case, transect length was defined according to the distance of the sixth adult from the beginning of the transect. When fewer than six individuals were observed in a given transect, transect length was extended up to 50 m to search for additional individuals. The efficiency of both methods was compared based on species rarefaction curves, using the Chao 1 statistic (for abundance data). For each species we calculated mean density per transect and basal area, according to each sampling method. Sampling effort in terms of the number of individual plants and the area necessary to characterize maximum species richness in each sampling method, as well as mean time taken to sample a single transect, were compared as measures of efficiency.        Important findings        An accurate estimate of species richness was achieved using both methods, but in the variable area method, a quarter of the number of individuals and half the area was sufficient to characterize maximum species richness. Density and basal area did not differ between methods for any of the species studied. In the fixed area method sampling effort was 90 min per transect, whereas in the variable area method it was 30 min per transect. The variable area method, with its faster assessment of palm species richness, should facilitate greater spatial representativeness by making it easier to sample a larger number of plots at different spatial scales. We thus find sufficient evidence to recommend the variable area method for rapid and robust evaluations of species richness for palms with aggregate distributions, as well as for other plants with similar spatial patterns, in tropical forests.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  31,10.1093/jpe/rtw085     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),basal area;biodiversity;inventory;palms;taxon sampling;FOREST;BIODIVERSITY;TRANSECT;ABUNDANCE;ARECACEAE;BRAZIL;PALMS,,

Here, we combine mechanistic models of fossil preservation and sequence evolution in simulations to evaluate different approaches to constructing fossil calibrations and their impact on Bayesian molecular clock dating, and the relative impact of fossil versus molecular sampling. We show that divergence time estimation is impacted by the model of fossil preservation, sampling intensity and tree shape. The addition of sequence data may improve molecular clock estimates, but accuracy and precision is dominated by the quality of the fossil calibrations. Posterior means and medians are poor representatives of true divergence times; posterior intervals provide a much more accurate estimate of divergence times, though they may be wide and often do not have high coverage probability.

In this paper, we develop an inverse method combining past inspection data on the pathway, an onshore inspection sample, and the Beta-Binomial model to infer the sample size of the offshore inspection. We illustrate the method on two case studies: the importation of live plants through germplasm into Australia and the importation of pelleted seeds in New Zealand. In these case studies, we found that detecting four to five infested units in a single onshore inspection was typically sufficient to significantly doubt the presence of a compliant offshore inspection. We also ran a simulation experiment to quantify the statistical power to reject or accept the presence of compliant offshore inspection in practice: In highly infested pathways, we could detect the absence of offshore inspections after inspecting five consignments onshore. Less infested pathways required inspecting 20 to 60 consignments onshore.

Location: Seven different vegetation types in Brazil - open ombrophilous Amazonian forest type in the state of Para State, dense ombrophilous Atlantic forest in the state of Sao Paulo, semi-deciduous and rupestrian field in the state of Minas Gerais, and three fast-growing eucalyptus plantations in the state of Sao Paulo.        Methods: Canopy height profiles were modelled for each forest type using a two-parameter Weibull distribution. Differences in the values of the Weibull cumulative distribution parameters were studied to evaluate their discriminative capacity. Simulation was subsequently used to determine the number of cells needed to define a reliable sampling intensity for each cell size tested. Eight grid cell sizes were tested against six sampling intensities using 1000 iterations for all seven forest types.        Results: Each forest presented distinct characteristics regarding the canopy height profile. The higher presence of ground returns was remarkable in less layered structured forests (i.e. rupestrian field and eucalyptus plantations). Depending on the forest type, monotonic and sigmoidal shapes were observed for the cumulative distribution function of the canopy height profile. A sigmoidal cumulative distribution function was typical of a more layered structure (dense and open ombrophilous, and semi-deciduous), whereas less structured typologies (i.e. Rupestrian field and forest plantation) were associated with monotonically shaped functions. Modelling convergence for the canopy height profile was achieved inmost cases with data representing at least 2% cover.        Conclusion: Canopy height profiles generated from ALS data proved different among five different forest types: open ombrophilous, dense ombrophilous, semi-deciduous, rupestrian field and eucalyptus plantations. Furthermore, large-scale forest inventories can benefit from the results observed in this study, as it provides recommendations on grid cell size and sampling intensity levels.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  45,10.1111/avsc.12224     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ALS;Foliage profile;Forest plantation;LiDAR;Light detection and ranging;Ombrophilous;Rupestrian field;Semi-deciduous;RAIN-FOREST;LIDAR;PATTERNS;STAND;TREE;VEGETATION;COMMUNITY;RESPONSES;HOTSPOT;BIOMASS;Trees,,

These models have been used to show that, at an appropriate spatial scale, dispersal parameters can be inferred from the regression of genetic differentiation against geographic distance between sampling locations. This approach is compelling because it is relatively simple and robust and has rather low sampling requirements. In continuous populations, dispersal can be inferred from isolation-by-distance patterns using either individuals or groups as sampling units. Intrigued by empirical findings where individual samples seemed to provide more power, we used simulations to compare the performances of the two methods in a range of situations with different dispersal distributions. We found that sampling individuals provide more power in a range of dispersal conditions that is narrow but fits many realistic situations. These situations were characterized not only by the general steepness of isolation-by-distance but also by the intrinsic shape of the dispersal kernel.

In the past, the association between metabolites (treated as quantitative traits) and genetic variants (e.g., SNPs) has been extensively studied using metabolomic quantitative trait locus (mQTL) mapping. Nevertheless, the research on the association between metabolites with agronomic traits has been inadequate. In practice, the regular approaches for QTL mapping analysis may be adopted for metabolites-phenotypes association analysis due to the similarity in data structure of these two types of researches. In the study, we compared four regular QTL mapping approaches, i.e., simple linear regression (LR), linear mixed model (LMM), Bayesian analysis with spike-slab priors (Bayes B) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), by testing their performances on the analysis of metabolome-phenotype associations. Simulation studies showed that LASSO had the higher power and lower false positive rate than the other three methods.

Using ten microsatellite loci as an indirect method to characterize dispersal, two-third of the genetic tests failed to detect a female-biased dispersal, and Monte Carlo simulations confirmed a low statistical power to detect sex-biased dispersal in case of high dispersal rate of both sexes. The capture-recapture data revealed a female-biased dispersal associated with an excess of heterozygote for the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R), which is responsible for their ventral rufous coloration. Thus, female homozygotes for the MC1R(WHITE) allele might be negatively selected during dispersal. Despite the higher immigration of females that are heterozygote at MC1R, non-random gene flow should not lead to a migration load regarding this gene because we did not detect an effect of MC1R on survival and reproductive success in our local population. The present study highlights the usefulness of using multiple methods to correctly decrypt dispersal and gene flow.

This area is the most polluted area in Slovakia, where in 1965 a dam failure of a coal ash impoundment released cca. 3 million m(3) of power plant fly ash with a high content of arsenic and other potentially toxic trace elements in the surrounding environment. Under the new morphogenetic classification system we call the soil with a layer of power plant ash as technosol. The total content of arsenic (As-TOT) in the studies samples is in the range of 109.65-1334.37 ppm. Mobility of arsenic in the anthropogenic materials was studied by sampling of pore waters using soil lysimeters (Prenart Equipment ApS, DK).The collected soil samples without homogenization and sieving (better simulation of natural conditions) were placed in experimental containers in which there were installed soil lysimeters. The aim of ex-situ experiments was to assess the mobility of toxic elements from solid samples using the selected leaching solutions (glucose+SAB medium, 1 mM citric acid, simulated acid rainwater) and compare their efficiency.

However, these new clustering techniques have not been rigorously tested to determine the performance variability based on the algorithm's assumptions or any underlying data structures. Here, we use simulation studies to estimate the statistical error rates for the hypothesis test for multivariate structure based on dissimilarity profiles (DISPROF). We concurrently tested a widely used algorithm that employs the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) to estimate the proficiency of clustering with DISPROF as a decision criterion. We simulated unstructured multivariate data from different probability distributions with increasing numbers of objects and descriptors, and grouped data with increasing overlap, overdispersion for ecological data, and correlation among descriptors within groups. Using simulated data, we measured the resolution and correspondence of clustering solutions achieved by DISPROF with UPGMA against the reference grouping partitions used to simulate the structured test datasets. Our results highlight the dynamic interactions between dataset dimensionality, group overlap, and the properties of the descriptors within a group (i.e., overdispersion or correlation structure) that are relevant to resemblance profiles as a clustering criterion for multivariate data. These methods are particularly useful for multivariate ecological datasets that benefit from distance-based statistical analyses.

Recently, doubts about the reliability of these methods have emerged. Here we explore how the results are affected by three confounding factors that may affect ecological data to different degrees: spatial autocorrelation of the environmental variables, length of the compositional gradient, and sampling noise. We document that the statistical hypotheses tested in these methods may or may not correspond to the ecological hypotheses of interest. A major discrepancy emerges if a large proportion of sampling units in the analysed dataset share no species, in which case compositional dissimilarities saturate to a fixed maximum value although explanatory dissimilarities do not. With increasing dissimilarity saturation, the explanatory power of regression models decrease, which may lead to the erroneous conclusion that the ecological processes represented by the explanatory variables are not operating. A survey of recent literature suggests that there is a general lack of awareness of this problem, although it appears to affect > 10% of relevant studies. Our simulations show that if dissimilarity saturation is due to a long ecological gradient, extended dissimilarities essentially solve the problem for any degree of saturation. Using distances from a hybrid multidimensional scaling alleviates the saturation problem when the degree of saturation is < 60%. However, neither correction method can provide a solution to problems caused by insufficient sampling. How the presence of multiple explanatory gradients in combination with sampling noise affects overall analysis performance remains to be clarified.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  49     Total Times Cited:  51     Cited Reference Count:  29,10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07339.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),EXPLAINING BETA DIVERSITY;MULTIPLE-REGRESSION;SPATIAL-ANALYSIS;MANTEL TEST;DISSIMILARITY;DISTINGUISH;PATTERNS;DISTANCE;FORESTS;TOOL,,

The reduction of dispersal across LTIs can drive small, local populations to extinction. To understand how LTIs modify dispersal, efficient and workable evaluation methods are required.        Objectives We developed a method based on Mark-Release-Recapture surveys to estimate barrier effects of LTIs that could be easily applied in various landscape contexts and on any mobile species.        Methods Our method uses dispersal kernels of animal movements to calculate an expected probability of crossing any particular linear feature. This probability is then compared to observed crossing events to estimate the barrier effect. We used simulations to test the reliability of our method and applied this framework on the butterfly Maniola jurtina in a landscape fragmented by a motorway and a railway.        Results Simulations showed that our method was able to detect efficiently even weak barrier effects given that enough data are available. When sample size was reduced, our method was able to detect barrier effects only when the infrastructure width was small in comparison to the average movement capacity of organisms. In our case study, both infrastructures acted as significant barriers.        Conclusions The power of our method is to use MRR data which are more representative of population processes than telemetry monitoring and are not limited by time-lag involved in genetic studies.

We used a simulation approach to examine the potential for RADseq data sets to accurately estimate effective population size (Ne) over the course of stable and declining population trends, and we compare the ability of two methods of analysis to accurately distinguish stable from steadily declining populations over a contemporary time scale (20 generations). Using a linkage disequilibrium-based analysis, individual sampling (i.e., n >= 30) had the greatest effect on Ne estimation and the detection of population size declines, with declines reliably detected across scenarios similar to 10 generations after they began. Coalescent-based inference required fewer sampled individuals (i.e., n = 15), and instead was most influenced by the size of the SNP data set, with 25,000-50,000 SNPs required for accurate detection of population trends and at least 20 generations after decline began. The number of samples available and targeted number of RADseq loci are important criteria when choosing between these methods. Neither method suffered any apparent bias due to the effects of allele dropout typical of RAD data. With an understanding of the limitations and biases of these approaches, researchers can make more informed decisions when designing their sampling and analyses. Overall, our results reveal that demographic inference using RADseq data can be successfully applied to infer recent population size change and may be an important tool for population monitoring and conservation biology.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  34     Total Times Cited:  34     Cited Reference Count:  45,10.1038/s41437-017-0037-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM;GENOMIC DATA;N-E;CONSERVATION;POWER;BOTTLENECK;DIVERSITY;ABUNDANCE;INFERENCE;GENETICS;Population Density,,

Although there has been considerable interest in the use of measures of species relatedness as tools to detect community assembly process, empirical and simulation studies have produced mixed results on the effectiveness of the technique. Here, we ask how well the most commonly used metrics of such community phylogenetic patterns detect the operation of filtering and competition in simulated communities where filtering and competition determine species abundances as well as co-occurrence patterns.        Location Simulated local communities assembled from a simulated regional species pool.        Methods We simulate the evolution of niche traits for a regional species pool on a phylogeny, and then simulate the assembly of a local community from this regional species pool using a Lotka-Volterra model. We then test whether the net relatedness index (NRI) or the nearest taxon index (NTI) can detect the assembly process. We compare the performance of abundance-weighted (NRIAW and NTIAW) and occurrence- based (NRIO and NTIO) versions of the metrics along a gradient of local community size as a percentage of the regional pool.        Results We find that abundance weighting can substantially increase the power to detect assembly processes. Moreover, clustering and over-dispersion are, in fact, most detectable when assembly processes act mainly on abundance rather than occurrence. Where they differed, NTIAW tended to outperform NRIAW at detecting limiting-similarity competition. NRIAW outperformed NTIAW at detecting filtering except when filtering was very strong compared with limiting-similarity competition.        Main conclusions Our findings imply that phylogenetic information is more likely to yield information about community assembly when abundance information is incorporated, and local communities contain a relatively large fraction of the regional species pool.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  37,10.1111/geb.12367     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Community assembly;environmental filtering;limiting similarity;nearest taxon index;net relatedness index;phylogenetic community structure.;ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES;FOREST COMMUNITY;ASSEMBLY RULES;TRAIT;DIVERSITY;PLANT;OVERDISPERSION;EVOLUTION;NICHE,,

Despite the increasing threat of IAS to the environment and economy, biosecurity efforts often lack suitable, scientifically-based methods to make effective management decisions, such as identifying an established IAS population from a single incursion event. We present a proof-of-concept for a new application of a stable isotope technique to identify wild and captive histories of an invasive pet species. Twelve red-eared slider turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans) from historic Australian incursions with putative wild, captive and unknown origins were analysed to: (1) present best-practice methods for stable isotope sampling of T.s. elegans incursions; (2) effectively discriminate between wild and captive groups using stable isotope ratios; and (3) present a framework to expand the methodology for use on other IAS species. A sampling method was developed to obtain carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope ratios from the keratin layer of the carapace (shells), which are predominantly influenced by dietary material and trophic level respectively. Both delta C-13 and delta N-15 exhibited the potential to distinguish between the wild and captive origins of the samples. Power simulations demonstrated that isotope ratios were consistent across the carapace and a minimum of eight individuals were required to effectively discriminate wild and captive groups, reducing overall sampling costs. Statistical classification effectively separated captive and wild groups by delta N-15 (captive: delta N-15 parts per thousand >= 9.7 parts per thousand, minimum of 96% accuracy). This study outlines a practical and accessible method for detecting IAS incursions, to potentially provide biosecurity staff and decision-makers with the tools to quickly identify and manage future IAS incursions.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  59,10.3897/neobiota.59.53671     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),biosecurity;invasive species;pet trade;provenancing;stable isotopes;Trachemys scripta elegans;wildlife trade;Emigrants and Immigrants,,

Nonparametric estimators such as Chao and Jackknife demonstrate strong performances, but consensus is lacking as to which estimator performs better under constrained sampling. We explore a method to improve the estimators under such scenario. The method we propose involves randomly splitting species-abundance data from a single sample into two equally sized samples, and using an appropriate incidence-based estimator to estimate richness. To test this method, we assume a lognormal species-abundance distribution (SAD) with varying coefficients of variation (CV), generate samples using MCMC simulations, and use the expected mean-squared error as the performance criterion of the estimators. We test this method for Chao, Jackknife, ICE, and ACE estimators. Between abundance-based estimators with the single sample, and incidence-based estimators with the split-in-two samples, Chao2 performed the best when CV < 0.65, and incidence-based Jackknife performed the best when CV > 0.65, given that the ratio of sample size to observed species richness is greater than a critical value given by a power function of CV with respect to abundance of the sampled population. The proposed method increases the performance of the estimators substantially and is more effective when more rare species are in an assemblage. We also show that the splitting method works qualitatively similarly well when the SADs are log series, geometric series, and negative binomial. We demonstrate an application of the proposed method by estimating richness of zooplankton communities in samples of ballast water. The proposed splitting method is an alternative to sampling a large number of individuals to increase the accuracy of richness estimations; therefore, it is appropriate for a wide range of resource-limited sampling scenarios in ecology.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  19,10.1002/ece3.2463     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),abundance-based estimator;biodiversity statistics;Chao;community ecology;incidence-based estimator;Jackknife;rare species;NUMBER,,

In many cases, default filtering thresholds for minor allele frequency and missing data are applied regardless of sample size, having unknown impacts on the results, negatively affecting management strategies. Here, we investigate the effects of filtering on GEA results and the potential implications for assessment of adaptation to environment. We use empirical and simulated data sets derived from two widespread tree species to assess the effects of filtering on GEA outputs. Critically, we find that the level of filtering of missing data and minor allele frequency affect the identification of true positives. Even slight adjustments to these thresholds can change the rate of true positive detection. Using conservative thresholds for missing data and minor allele frequency substantially reduces the size of the data set, lessening the power to detect adaptive variants (i.e., simulated true positives) with strong and weak strengths of selection. Regardless, strength of selection was a good predictor for GEA detection, but even some SNPs under strong selection went undetected. False positive rates varied depending on the species and GEA method, and filtering significantly impacted the predictions of adaptive capacity in downstream analyses. We make several recommendations regarding filtering for GEA methods.

In this study, we provide guidelines for the use of popular or recently developed statistical methods to detect footprints of selection. We simulated 100 populations along a selective gradient and explored different migration models, sampling schemes and rates of self-fertilization. We investigated the power and robustness of eight methods to detect loci potentially under selection: three designed to detect genotypeenvironment correlations and five designed to detect adaptive differentiation (based on FST or similar measures). We show that genotypeenvironment correlation methods have substantially more power to detect selection than differentiation-based methods but that they generally suffer from high rates of false positives. This effect is exacerbated whenever allele frequencies are correlated, either between populations or within populations. Our results suggest that, when the underlying genetic structure of the data is unknown, a number of robust methods are preferable. Moreover, in the simulated scenario we used, sampling many populations led to better results than sampling many individuals per population.

Incongruence in delimitation schemes is a potential by-product of employing multiple methods on the same data, and little attention has been paid to its reconciliation. Instead, a particular scheme is prioritized, and/or molecular delimitations are coupled with additional, independent lines of evidence that mitigate incongruence. We advocate that incongruence within a line of evidence should be accounted for before comparing across lines of evidence that can themselves be incongruent. Additionally, it is not uncommon for empiricists working in nonmodel systems to be data-limited, generating some concern for the adequacy of available data to address the question of interest. With conservation and management decisions often hinging on the status of species, it seems prudent to understand the capabilities of approaches we use given the data we have. Here, we apply two molecular species delimitation approaches, spedeSTEM and BPP, to the Castilleja ambigua (Orobanchaceae) species complex, a relatively young plant lineage in western North America. Upon finding incongruence in our delimitation, we employed a post hoc simulation study to examine the power of these approaches to delimit species. Given the data we collected, we find that spedeSTEM lacks the power to delimit while BPP is capable, thus allowing us to address incongruence before proceeding in delimitation. We suggest post hoc simulation studies like this compliment empirical delimitation and serve as a means of exploring conflict within a line of evidence and dealing with it appropriately.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  92,10.1111/mec.14590     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),BPP;Castilleja;incongruent delimitation scheme;simulation;species delimitation;spedeSTEM;PHYLOGENETIC UTILITY;INTEGRATIVE TAXONOMY;CHROMOSOME-NUMBERS;CASTILLEJA;MULTILOCUS;DNA;OROBANCHACEAE;POLYPLOIDY;MODEL;SCROPHULARIACEAE,,

Surveys employing small, spatially replicated sampling units improve efficiency, but statistical estimators rely on assumptions that constrain survey design or become less reasonable as larger areas are sampled. Efficient methods that avoid assumptions about similarity of detectability or density among replicates are therefore appealing. Using simulations and data from >3500 black bears sampled on 73 independent study areas in Ontario, Canada, we (1) quantified bias induced by unmodeled spatial heterogeneity in detectability and density; (2) evaluated novel, design-based estimators of average density across replicate study areas; and (3) evaluated two estimators of the variance of average density across study areas: an analytic estimator that assumed an underlying homogeneous spatial Poisson point process for the distribution of animals' activity centers, and an empirical estimator of variance across study areas. In simulations where detectability varied in space, assuming spatially constant detectability yielded density estimates that were negatively biased by 20% to 30%; estimating local detectability and density from local data and treating study areas as independent, equal replicates when estimating average density across study areas using the design-based estimator yielded unbiased estimates at local and landscape scales. Similarly, detectability of black bears varied among study areas and estimates of bear density at landscape scales were higher when no information was shared across study areas when estimating detectability. This approach also maximized precision (relative SEs of estimates of average black bear density ranged from 7% to 18%) and computational efficiency. In simulations, the analytic variance estimator was robust to threefold variation in local densities but the empirical estimator performed poorly. Conducting multiple, similar SECR surveys and treating them as independent replicates during analyses allowed us to efficiently estimate density at multiple scales and extents while avoiding biases caused by pooling spatially heterogeneous data.

The computer model environment allows us to strictly control for variables such as SST, foraminifera species abundance response to SST, as well as depositional processes such as sediment accumulation rate (SAR) and bioturbation depth (BD) and subsequent laboratory processes such as sample size and machine error. Examining a number of best-case scenarios, we find that IFA-derived reconstructions of past SST variability are sensitive to all of the aforementioned variables. Running 100 ensembles for each scenario, we find that the influence of bioturbation upon IFA-derived SST reconstructions, combined with typical samples sizes employed in the field, produces noisy SST reconstructions with poor correlation to the original SST distribution in the water. This noise is especially apparent for values near the tails of the SST distribution, which is the distribution region of particular interest in the case of, e.g. ENSO. The noise is further increased in the case of increasing machine error, decreasing SAR and decreasing sample size. We also find poor agreement between ensembles, underscoring the need for replication studies in the field to confirm findings at particular sites and time periods. Furthermore, we show that a species abundance response to SST could in theory bias IFA-derived SST reconstructions, which can have consequences when comparing IFA-derived SST distributions from markedly different mean climate states.

In an effort to determine the best (i.e. efficient, accurate, precise, cost-effective) method for abundance estimation, we used simulations to examine the optimal genetic capture-recapture faecal sampling design for this population.

We explored trade-offs between sample size, number of sessions and multi-session (MARK) versus single-session (capwire) closed capture-recapture abundance estimators, and an accurate and precise estimate. We also compared the cost between the genetic capture-recapture approaches and current aerial monitoring methods. Abundance was biased positively in capwire and negatively in MARK. Bias increased and precision decreased with fewer samples/individual/session. Annual genetic capture-recapture monitoring cost was nearly twice the cost of aerial surveys, although genetic capture-recapture methods provided much higher precision. However at the current estimated abundance (c. 200), the same level of precision achieved with aerial methods can be obtained by collecting 0.75 samples/individual in a single session, for an annual cost saving of > USD 4,000.

Several camera trapping-based methods for estimating densities have been developed, one of which, the random encounter model (REM), has been widely applied due to its practical advantages such as no need for species-specific study design. Nevertheless, most of the studies in which REM has been assessed against referenced methods have sampled one population, precluding evaluation of the circumstances under which REM does or does not perform well. At this point, a review of all REM assessments could be useful to provide an overview of method reliability and highlight the main factors determining REM performance. Here we used a combination of literature review and empirical study to compare the performance of REM with independent methods. We reviewed 34 studies where REM was applied to 45 species, reporting 77 REM-reference density comparisons; and we also sampled 13 populations (ungulates and lagomorphs) in which we assessed REM performance against independent densities. The results suggested that appropriate procedures to estimate REM parameters (namely day range, detection zone and encounter rate) are mandatory to obtain unbiased densities. Deficient estimates of day range and encounter rate lead to an overestimation of density, while deficient estimates of detection zone conducted to underestimations. Finally, the precision achieved by REM was lower than reference methods, mainly because of the high levels of spatial aggregation observed in natural populations. In this situation, simulation-based results suggest that c. 60 camera placements should be sampled to achieve acceptable precision (i.e. coefficient of variation below 0.20). The wide range of situations and scenarios included in this study allow us to conclude that REM is a reliable method for estimating wildlife population density when using appropriate estimates of REM parameters and sampling designs. Overall, these results pave the way to wider application of REM for monitoring terrestrial mammals.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  63,10.1002/rse2.269,Camera trapping;non-invasive;population abundance;population density;random encounter model;unmarked;ESTIMATING ANIMAL DENSITY;DISTANCE;ABUNDANCE;RANGE;BIAS;Population Density,,

Estimates of breeding population size (N-S) are particularly amenable to genetic-based approaches as the parameter can be estimated using pedigrees reconstructed from genetic data gathered from discrete juvenile cohorts, therefore eliminating the need to sample adults in the population. However, a critical evaluation of how genotyping and sampling effort influence bias in pedigree reconstruction, and how these biases subsequently influence estimates of N-S, is needed to evaluate the efficacy of the approach under a range of scenarios. We simulated a model system to understand the interactive effects of genotyping and sampling effort on error in genetic pedigrees reconstructed from the program COLONY. We then evaluated how errors in pedigree reconstruction influenced bias and precision in estimates of N-S using three different rarefaction estimators. Results indicated that pedigree error can be minimal when adequate genetic data are available, such as when juvenile sample sizes are large and/or individuals are genotyped at many informative loci. However, even in cases for which data are limited, using results of the simulation analysis to understand the magnitude and sources of bias in reconstructed pedigrees can still be informative when estimating N-S. We applied results of the simulation analysis to evaluate N$$ \hat{N} $$(S) for a population of federally endangered Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus) in the Delaware River, USA. Our results indicated that N-S is likely to be three orders of magnitude lower compared with historic breeding population sizes, which is a considerable advancement in our understanding of the population status of Atlantic sturgeon in the Delaware River. Our analyses are broadly applicable in the design and interpretation of studies seeking to estimate N-S and can help to guide conservation decisions when ecological uncertainty is high.

We posit this is a result of inconsistent and improper timing of nest-site vegetation measurements. Therefore, we evaluated how the timing of nest vegetation measurement influences the estimated effects of vegetation structure on nest survival. We simulated phenological changes in nest-site vegetation growth over a typical nesting season and modeled how the timing of measuring that vegetation, relative to nest fate, creates bias in conclusions regarding its influence on nest survival. We modeled the bias associated with four methods of measuring nest-site vegetation: Method 1measuring at nest initiation, Method 2measuring at nest termination regardless of fate, Method 3measuring at nest termination for successful nests and at estimated completion for unsuccessful nests, and Method 4measuring at nest termination regardless of fate while also accounting for initiation date. We quantified and compared bias for each method for varying simulated effects, ranked models for each method using AIC, and calculated the proportion of simulations in which each model (measurement method) was selected as the best model. Our results indicate that the risk of drawing an erroneous or spurious conclusion was present in all methods but greater with Method 2 which is the most common method reported in the literature. Methods 1 and 3 were similarly less biased. Method 4 provided no additional value as bias was similar to Method 2 for all scenarios.

When this relationship is evaluated using data derived from broad-scale geographic distributions of species, spatial autocorrelation of species distribution data and environments may inflate niche breadth-range size relationships, bringing into question the causal relationship between environmental tolerance and range size. Using null models, we quantify the contribution of spatial autocorrelation to the frequently reported relationship between species' range size and niche breadth. Location Time period South Africa. Current. Major taxa studied Methods Eighty species in the genus Pelargonium. Using phylogenetic least squares regression, we examined the extent to which variation in range size of Pelargonium species is related to temperature and precipitation niche breadths. We developed null models that randomized the spatial distribution of the climatic variables, but retained their broad spatial autocorrelation structure. We tested whether observed niche breadth-range size relationships were stronger than expected, given spatial autocorrelation of climatic variables. Results Main conclusion We found the expected positive relationships between measures of niche breadth and range size, but these were no stronger than expected based on our spatial null models. Including spatial structure in simulations reduced expected niche breadths compared to simulations based on fully randomized environmental variables, resulting in steeper slopes for the simulated niche breadth-range size relationships. Our results indicate that spatial autocorrelation may positively bias niche breadth-range size relationships.

For quantification purposes, a large number of landscape metrics have been developed, with definitions based on measurable patch attributes. Calculation of these metrics is commonly conducted on wall-to-wall maps, whereas a new interest is to use sample data. It is argued that a sample survey takes less time and results are more reliable. The overall objective in this paper was to present the potential of the line interest sampling method for estimating a special contagion metric. The specific objective was to assess statistical properties in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and bias of the contagion metric estimator. This study was conducted on 50.1 km(2) already manually delineated land cover maps from the National Inventory of Landscape in Sweden. Monte-Carlo sampling simulation was employed to assess the statistical properties of the estimator. The simulation was conducted for different combinations of two sampling designs, four sample sizes, five lines transect configurations, three lines transect lengths, and two classification systems. The systematic sampling design resulted in lower RMSE and bias compared to a simple random one. Both RMSE and bias of the contagion estimator tended to decrease with increasing sample size and line transect length. We recommend using a combination of systematic sampling design, straight line configuration and long line transect. We conclude that there is no need to use mapped data and thus polygon delineation errors can considerably be reduced or eliminated.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  37,10.1007/s11355-014-0260-0     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Spatial indicators;Landscape metrics;Monte-Carlo simulation;Bias;Root mean square error;LANDSCAPE METRICS;INVENTORY;PATTERN;INDEXES;DESIGN;VECTOR;RASTER;AREA;Metronidazole,,

These methods usually depend on species attributes that are not always available and very often ignore imperfect species detection. In this work, we developed a new method to characterize species rarity in a community when species are detected imperfectly. Our modelling framework is based on Bayesian occupancy models to estimate species distributions under imperfect detection using presence-nondetection data. Innovation We propose a finite mixture occupancy model to identify rare species based on their occupancy and class-membership probabilities. Here, we explored a two-class finite mixture model to distinguish between rare and common species classes and presented the general modelling framework for a problem with more than two classes. By using simulations, we were able to compare our model results under different scenarios obtaining a high-classification performance across all of them. Additionally, we applied our model to a data set of Odonata occurrence records that were partially observed due to imperfect detection and quantified the proportion of rare species on a national scale across waterbodies in the United Kingdom. Main conclusions Nowadays, biodiversity conservation involves monitoring programmes that target multiple species within a community where individual species responses may vary widely. This high variability makes the task of identifying the ecological processes that drive distributions of rare species difficult. Thus, our method represents a new approach to characterize the composition of a community in terms of species rarity while correcting for detectability bias.

Ignoring sampling uncertainty might lead to biased estimation of the strength of density dependence. This is typically addressed using state-space model approaches, which integrate sampling error and population process estimates. Such models seldom include an explicit link between the sampling procedures and the true abundance, which is common in capture-recapture settings. However, many of the models proposed to estimate abundance in the presence of capture heterogeneity lead to incomplete likelihood functions and cannot be straightforwardly included in state-space models. We assessed the importance of estimating sampling error explicitly by taking an intermediate approach between ignoring uncertainty in abundance estimates and fully specified state-space models for density-dependence estimation based on autoregressive processes. First, we estimated individual capture probabilities based on a heterogeneity model for a closed population, using a conditional multinomial likelihood, followed by a Horvitz-Thompson estimate for abundance. Second, we estimated coefficients of autoregressive models for the log abundance. Inference was performed using the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). We performed an extensive simulation study to compare our approach with estimates disregarding capture history information, and using R-package VGAM, for different parameter specifications. The methods were then applied to a real data set of gray-sided volesMyodes rufocanusfrom Northern Norway. We found that density-dependence estimation was improved when explicitly modeling sampling error in scenarios with low process variances, in which differences in coverage reached up to 8% in estimating the coefficients of the autoregressive processes. In this case, the bias also increased assuming a Poisson distribution in the observational model. For high process variances, the differences between methods were small and it appeared less important to model heterogeneity.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  50,10.1002/ece3.6642,abundance;capture probability;closed population models;density dependence;INLA;process variance;ESTIMATING DENSITY-DEPENDENCE;TIME-SERIES;MODELS;CYCLES;FLUCTUATIONS;COMPLEXITY;INFERENCE;SURVIVAL;VOLES;BIAS;Animal Shells;Animals,,

Choices regarding optimal models, methods and data are typically made based on discrimination accuracy: a model's ability to predict subsets of species occurrence data that were withheld during model construction. However, empirical applications of these models often involve making biological inferences based on continuous estimates of relative habitat suitability as a function of environmental predictor variables. We term the reliability of these biological inferences 'functional accuracy.' We explore the link between discrimination accuracy and functional accuracy. Methods Using a simulation approach we investigate whether models that make good predictions of species distributions correctly infer the underlying relationship between environmental predictors and the suitability of habitat. Results We demonstrate that discrimination accuracy is only informative when models are simple and similar in structure to the true niche, or when data partitioning is geographically structured. However, the utility of discrimination accuracy for selecting models with high functional accuracy was low in all cases. Main conclusions These results suggest that many empirical studies and decisions are based on criteria that are unrelated to models' usefulness for their intended purpose. We argue that empirical modelling studies need to place significantly more emphasis on biological insight into the plausibility of models, and that the current approach of maximizing discrimination accuracy at the expense of other considerations is detrimental to both the empirical and methodological literature in this active field. Finally, we argue that future development of the field must include an increased emphasis on simulation; methodological studies based on ability to predict withheld occurrence data may be largely uninformative about best practices for applications where interpretation of models relies on estimating ecological processes, and will unduly penalize more biologically informative modelling approaches.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  42     Total Times Cited:  44     Cited Reference Count:  75,10.1111/jbi.13705,ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS;CLIMATE-CHANGE;SAMPLING BIAS;COMPLEXITY;PERFORMANCE;IMPROVE;TRANSFERABILITY;PREDICTIONS;ENVIRONMENT;VALIDATION;Discrimination (Psychology),,

Among the many factors that control evapotranspiration, phenology poses a major source of uncertainty in attempts to predict ET. Contemporary approaches to ET modeling and monitoring frequently summarize the complexity of the seasonal development of vegetation cover into static phenological trajectories (or climatologies) that lack sensitivity to changing environmental conditions. The Event Driven Phenology Model (EDPM) offers an alternative, interactive approach to representing phenology. This study presents the results of an experiment designed to illustrate the differences in ET arising from various techniques used to mimic phenology in models of land surface processes. The experiment compares and contrasts two realizations of static phenologies derived from long-term satellite observations of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) against canopy trajectories produced by the interactive EDPM trained on flux tower observations. The assessment was carried out through validation of predicted ET against records collected by flux tower instruments. The VegET model (Senay, 2008) was used as a framework to estimate daily actual evapotranspiration and supplied with seasonal canopy trajectories produced by the EDPM and traditional techniques. The interactive approach presented the following advantages over phenology modeled with static climatologies: (a) lower prediction bias in crops; (b) smaller root mean square error in daily ET - 0.5 mm per day on average; (c) stable level of errors throughout the season similar among different land cover types and locations; and (d) better estimation of season duration and total seasonal ET.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  70,10.5194/bg-9-161-2012     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),LAND-SURFACE PHENOLOGY;ENERGY-BALANCE;VEGETATION DYNAMICS;CLIMATE;MODIS;INDEX;EVAPORATION;TEMPERATURE;SIMULATION;HYDROLOGY,,

However, some behaviors are more difficult to observe than others, which can bias analyses of raw observational data. To our knowledge, no method currently exists to model how animals use different environments while accounting for imperfect behavior-specific detection probability. We developed an extension of a binomial N-mixture model (hereafter the behavior N-mixture model) to estimate the probability of a given behavior occurring in a particular environment while accounting for imperfect detection. We then conducted a simulation to validate the model's ability to estimate the effects of environmental covariates on the probabilities of individuals performing different behaviors. We compared our model to a naive model that does not account for imperfect detection, as well as a traditional N-mixture model. Finally, we applied the model to a bird observation data set in northwest Costa Rica to quantify how three species behave in forests and farms. Simulations and sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the behavior N-mixture model produced unbiased estimates of behaviors and their relationships with predictor variables (e.g., forest cover, habitat type). Importantly, the behavior N-mixture model accurately characterized uncertainty, unlike the naive model, which often suggested erroneous effects of covariates on behaviors. When applied to field data, the behavior N-mixture model suggested that Hoffmann's woodpecker (Melanerpes hoffmanii) and Inca dove (Columbina inca) behaved differently in forested versus agricultural habitats, while turquoise-browed motmot (Eumomota superciliosa) did not. Thus, the behavior N-mixture model can help identify habitats that are essential to a species' life cycle (e.g., where individuals nest, forage) that nonbehavioral models would miss. Our model can greatly improve the appropriate use of behavioral survey data and conclusions drawn from them. In doing so, it provides a valuable path forward for assessing the conservation value of alternative habitat types.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  36,10.1002/eap.2632,agricultural systems;Bayesian hierarchical model;Bayesian methods;behavior change;behavior survey;N-mixture model;tropical birds;HABITAT QUALITY;OCCUPANCY;DENSITY,,

Under random temporary emigration, unbiased parameters can be estimated with CJS models. However, unmodeled Markovian temporary emigration causes bias in parameter estimates, and an unobservable state is required to model this type of emigration. The robust design is most flexible when modeling temporary emigration, and partial solutions to mitigate bias have been identified; nonetheless, there are conditions were terminal bias prevails. Long-lived species with high adult survival and highly variable nonrandom temporary emigration present terminal bias in survival estimates, despite being modeled with the robust design and suggested constraints. Because this bias is due to uncertainty about the fate of individuals that are undetected toward the end of the time series, solutions should involve using additional information on survival status or location of these individuals at that time. Using simulation, we evaluated the performance of models that jointly analyze robust design data and an additional source of ancillary data (predictive covariate on temporary emigration, telemetry, dead recovery, or auxiliary resightings) in reducing terminal bias in survival estimates. The auxiliary resighting and predictive covariate models reduced terminal bias the most. Additional telemetry data were effective at reducing terminal bias only when individuals were tracked for a minimum of two years. High adult survival of long-lived species made the joint model with recovery data ineffective at reducing terminal bias because of small-sample bias. The naive constraint model (last and penultimate temporary emigration parameters made equal), was the least efficient, although still able to reduce terminal bias when compared to an unconstrained model. Joint analysis of several sources of data improved parameter estimates and reduced terminal bias. Efforts to incorporate or acquire such data should be considered by researchers and wildlife managers, especially in the years leading up to status assessments of species of interest.

Gas diffusion is considered to be the main transport process in the soil. Because accumulation of gases within the chamber decreases concentration gradients between soil and the chamber over time, the surface efflux of gases decreases as well, and gas production rates are underestimated if calculated from chamber concentrations without consideration of this mechanism. Moreover, concentration gradients to the non-labelled subsoil exist, inevitably causing downward diffusion of N-15-labelled denitrification products. A numerical 3-D model for simulating gas diffusion in soil was used in order to determine the significance of this source of error. Results show that subsoil diffusion of N-15-labelled N-2 and N2O - and thus potential underestimation of denitrification derived from chamber fluxes - increases with chamber deployment time as well as with increasing soil gas diffusivity. Simulations based on the range of typical soil gas diffusivities of unsaturated soils showed that the fraction of N-2 and N2O evolved from N-15-labelled NO3- that is not emitted at the soil surface during 1 h chamber closing is always significant, with values up to > 50% of total production. This is due to accumulation in the pore space of the N-15-labelled soil and diffusive flux to the unlabelled subsoil. Empirical coefficients to calculate denitrification from surface fluxes were derived by modelling multiple scenarios with varying soil water content. Modelling several theoretical experimental set-ups showed that the fraction of produced gases that are retained in soil can be lowered by lowering the depth of N-15 labelling and/or increasing the length of the confining cylinder.        Field experiments with arable silt loam soil for measuring denitrification with the N-15 gas flux method were conducted to obtain direct evidence for the incomplete surface emission of gaseous denitrification products. We compared surface fluxes of N-15(2) and (N2O)-N-15 from N-15-labelled micro-plots confined by cylinders using the closed-chamber method with cylinders open or closed at the bottom, finding 37% higher surface fluxes with the bottom closed. Modelling fluxes of this experiment confirmed this effect, however with a higher increase in surface flux of 89 %.        From our model and experimental results we conclude that field surface fluxes of N-15-labelled N-2 and N2O severely underestimate denitrification rates if calculated from chamber accumulation only. The extent of this underestimation increases with closure time. Underestimation also occurs during laboratory incubations in closed systems due to pore space accumulation of N-15-labelled N-2 and N2O. Due to this bias in past denitrification measurements, denitrification in soils might be more relevant than assumed to date.        Corrected denitrification rates can be obtained by estimating subsurface flux and storage with our model. The observed deviation between experimental and modelled subsurface flux revealed the need for refined model evaluation, which must include assessment of the spatial variability in diffusivity and production and the spatial dimension of the chamber.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  47,10.5194/bg-16-2233-2019     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),NITROUS-OXIDE;AUTOMATED-DETERMINATION;TRACER TECHNIQUES;SOIL;N-2;ACETYLENE;FOREST;N2O;EXPRESSION;DINITROGEN,,

However, multiple methodological choices are required during the modelling process, some of which may have a large impact on forecasting results. In this context, virtual species, i.e. the use of simulations involving a fictitious species for which we have perfect knowledge of its occurrence-environment relationships and other relevant characteristics, have become increasingly popular to test SDMs. This approach provides for a simple virtual ecologist framework under which to test model properties, as well as the effects of the different methodological choices, and allows teasing out the effects of targeted factors with great certainty. This simplification is therefore very useful in setting up modelling standards and best practice principles. As a result, numerous virtual species studies have been published over the last decade. The topics covered include differences in performance between statistical models, effects of sample size, choice of threshold values, methods to generate pseudo-absences for presence-only data, among many others. These simulations have therefore already made a great contribution to setting best modelling practices in SDMs. Recent software developments have greatly facilitated the simulation of virtual species, with at least three different packages published to that effect. However, the simulation procedure has not been homogeneous, which introduces some subtleties in the interpretation of results, as well as differences across simulation packages. Here we 1) review the main contributions of the virtual species approach in the SDM literature; 2) compare the major virtual species simulation approaches and software packages; and 3) propose a set of recommendations for best simulation practices in future virtual species studies in the context of SDMs.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  30     Total Times Cited:  30     Cited Reference Count:  77,10.1111/ecog.04385     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),artificial species;environmental niche models;niche;simulations;species distribution modelling;virtual ecologist;PRESENCE-ABSENCE DATA;FAVORABILITY FUNCTIONS;IMPERFECT DETECTION;DETECTING OUTLIERS;PSEUDO-ABSENCES;SAMPLE-SIZE;PERFORMANCE;BIAS;PREVALENCE;ACCURACY,,

Three typical observation points (sites A, B, and C) were selected to understand the relationship between plant transpiration, soil water content changes, and groundwater level depth via HYDRUS1D model simulations. The model calibration results showed that the simulated water contents at each site and in each soil layer fit well with the measured data and the comparison results of each sites are R-A(2) = 0.81, R-B(2) = 0.89, R-C(2) = 0.78, in respectively. The soil water balance model of the three different sites demonstrated that vegetation transpiration was related to the groundwater level depth, vegetation cover, and plant age (P. euphratica). According to field observations within the WeiGan-KuChe River delta oasis, the groundwater level depth influenced the soil moisture and soil salinity, which are the most important environmental factors determining the distribution and changes in GDV. When the groundwater level depth was below 1 m or above 6 m, the plant species occurrence frequency decreased by 10%, and the degree of land desertification was severe. These simulations and field investigation results showed that the groundwater level threshold for salinity control was approximately 1 m, the ecological warning threshold varied by approximately 5 m, and the preferred groundwater level for GDV growth varied between 2 and 4 m. The findings of this study have important implications for groundwater resource management and ecological preservation in arid and semiarid areas. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

This rapid warming has a wide range of impacts on polar and sub-polar marine ecosystems. One of the examples of such an impact on ecosystems is that of coccolithophores, particularly Emiliania huxleyi, which have expanded their range pole-ward during recent decades. The coccolithophore E. huxleyi plays an essential role in the global carbon cycle. Therefore, the assessment of future changes in coccolithophore blooms is very important.        Currently, there are a large number of climate models that give projections for various oceanographic, meteorological, and biochemical variables in the Arctic. However, individual climate models can have large biases when compared to historical observations. The main goal of this research was to select an ensemble of climate models that most accurately reproduces the state of environmental variables that influence the coccolithophore E. huxleyi bloom over the historical period when compared to reanalysis data. We developed a novel approach for model selection to include a diverse set of measures of model skill including the spatial pattern of some variables, which had not previously been included in a model selection procedure. We applied this method to each of the Arctic and sub-Arctic seas in which E. huxleyi blooms have been observed. Once we have selected an optimal combination of climate models that most skilfully reproduce the factors which affect E. huxleyi, the projections of the future conditions in the Arctic from these models can be used to predict how E. huxleyi blooms will change in the future.        Here, we present the validation of 34 CMIP5 (fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs) over the historical period 1979-2005. Furthermore, we propose a procedure of ranking and selecting these models based on the model's skill in reproducing 10 important oceanographic, meteorological, and biochemical variables in the Arctic and sub-Arctic seas. These factors include the concentration of nutrients (NO3, PO4, and SI), dissolved CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)), pH, sea surface temperature (SST), salinity averaged over the top 30m (SS30m), 10m wind speed (WS), ocean surface current speed (OCS), and surface downwelling shortwave radiation (SDSR). The validation of the GCMs' outputs against reanalysis data includes analysis of the interannual variability, seasonal cycle, spatial biases, and temporal trends of the simulated variables. In total, 60 combinations of models were selected for 10 variables over six study regions using the selection procedure we present here. The results show that there is neither a combination of models nor one model that has high skill in reproducing the regional climatic-relevant features of all combinations of the considered variables in target seas. Thereby, an individual subset of models was selected according to our model selection procedure for each combination of variable and Arctic or sub-Arctic sea. Following our selection procedure, the number of selected models in the individual subsets varied from 3 to 11.        The paper presents a comparison of the selected model subsets and the full-model ensemble of all available CMIP5 models to reanalysis data. The selected subsets of models generally show a better performance than the full-model ensemble. Therefore, we conclude that within the task addressed in this study it is preferable to employ the model subsets determined through application of our procedure than the full-model ensemble.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  73,10.5194/bg-17-1199-2020     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),NORTH-ATLANTIC;COCCOLITHOPHORE BLOOMS;PHYTOPLANKTON;OCEAN;CARBON;QUANTIFICATION;CALCIFICATION;PERFORMANCE;PROJECTIONS;ENSEMBLE,,

The rates or probabilities for these processes can vary by time, by location, and by individual. These processes can co-vary and interact to varying degrees, e.g., an animal can only reproduce when it is in a particular maturation state. Population dynamics models that treat the processes as independent may yield somewhat biased or imprecise parameter estimates, as well as predictions of population abundances or densities. However, commonly used integral projection models (IPMs) typically assume independence across these demographic processes. We examine several approaches for modelling between process dependence in IPMs and include cases where the processes co-vary as a function of time (temporal variation), co-vary within each individual (individual heterogeneity), and combinations of these (temporal variation and individual heterogeneity). We compare our methods to conventional IPMs, which treat vital rates independent, using simulations and a case study of Soay sheep (Ovis aries). In particular, our results indicate that correlation between vital rates can moderately affect variability of some population-level statistics. Therefore, including such dependent structures is generally advisable when fitting IPMs to ascertain whether or not such between vital rate dependencies exist, which in turn can have subsequent impact on population management or life-history evolution.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  62,10.1002/ece3.8682     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),copula models;correlated vital rates;generalized linear mixed models;population growth rate;reproduction investment;Soay sheep;LINEAR MIXED MODELS;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;INDIVIDUAL HETEROGENEITY;ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE;GROWTH;EVOLUTION;CONSTRUCTION;REPRODUCTION;TRAJECTORIES;SIMULATIONS,,

Most species distribution modelling techniques produce continuous suitability predictions, but many real applications (e.g. reserve design, species invasion and climate change impact assessment) and model evaluations require binary outputs, and thresholds are needed for these transformations. Although there are many threshold selection methods for presence/absence data, it is unclear whether these are suitable for presence-only data. In this paper, we investigate mathematically and empirically which of the existing threshold selection methods can be used confidently with presence-only data. Location We used real spatially explicit environmental data derived from the western part of the state of Victoria, south-eastern Australia, and simulated species distributions within this area. Methods Thirteen existing threshold selection methods were investigated mathematically to see whether the same threshold can be produced using either presence/absence data or presence-only data. We further adopted a simulation approach, created many virtual species with differing prevalences in a real landscape in south-eastern Australia, generated data sets with different proportions of pseudo-absences, built eight types of models with four modelling techniques, and investigated the behaviours of four threshold selection methods in these situations. Results Three threshold selection methods were not affected by pseudo-absences, including max SSS (which is based on maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity), the prevalence of model training data and the mean predicted value of a set of random points. Max SSS produced higher sensitivity in most cases and higher true skill statistic and kappa in many cases than the other methods. The other methods produced different thresholds from presence-only data to those determined from presence/absence data.

Existing models that combine information from multiple field methods or sampling devices permit rigorous comparison of method-specific detection parameters, enable estimation of additional parameters such as false-positive detection probability, and improve occurrence or abundance estimates, but with the assumption that the separate sampling methods produce detections independently of one another. This assumption is tenuous if methods are paired or deployed in close proximity simultaneously, a common practice that reduces the additional effort required to implement multiple methods and reduces the risk that differences between method-specific detection parameters are confounded by other environmental factors. We develop occupancy and spatial capture-recapture models that permit covariance between the detections produced by different methods, use simulation to compare estimator performance of the new models to models assuming independence, and provide an empirical application based on American marten (Martes americana) surveys using paired remote cameras, hair catches, and snow tracking. Simulation results indicate existing models that assume that methods independently detect organisms produce biased parameter estimates and substantially understate estimate uncertainty when this assumption is violated, while our reformulated models are robust to either methodological independence or covariance. Empirical results suggested that remote cameras and snow tracking had comparable probability of detecting present martens, but that snow tracking also produced false-positive marten detections that could potentially substantially bias distribution estimates if not corrected for. Remote cameras detected marten individuals more readily than passive hair catches. Inability to photographically distinguish individual sex did not appear to induce negative bias in camera density estimates; instead, hair catches appeared to produce detection competition between individuals that may have been a source of negative bias. Our model reformulations broaden the range of circumstances in which analyses incorporating multiple sources of information can be robustly used, and our empirical results demonstrate that using multiple field-methods can enhance inferences regarding ecological parameters of interest and improve understanding of how reliably survey methods sample these parameters.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  30     Total Times Cited:  30     Cited Reference Count:  57,10.1002/eap.1587     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),American marten;density;false positive detection;Martes americana;monitoring;multi-method;dependence;noninvasive methods;occupancy;spatial capture-recapture methods;survey design;SCAT DETECTION DOGS;DENSITY-ESTIMATION;AMERICAN MARTEN;OCCUPANCY;IDENTIFICATION;FRAMEWORK;FOREST;TRAP,,

We developed and evaluated data collection methods and minimum sampling requirements to inform local-scale models of NNS distribution. We also evaluated overall model predictive performance for 16 species at two sites and determined how classes of variables contributed to model performance and suggest invasion drivers.        Location Wyoming and Idaho, USA        Methods A simulation study was used to test the efficiency of different sampling methods to predict imposed species distributions. Empirical distribution models of species occurrence data from two environmentally disparate sites were cross-validated at increasing sample sizes, and the asymptotic maximum predictive performance and relative contribution of classes of variables were determined for 16 NNS.        Results Transect sampling was the most efficient method for maximizing model performance after accounting for logistics. Minimum sample sizes to reach model maximum predictive performance were similar for the simulation (< 0.5% of study area) and empirical studies (mean of 0.13% using transects). Maximum predictive performance tended to be greater at the site with steeper environmental gradients, and topo-climatic/biotic variables were most important to model improvement.        Main conclusions Local-scale SDMs can be useful to NNS managers. Using transect methodology, enough data can be collected (ca. 0.13% of the management area) to fit models within logistical/budgetary constraints. These models are most predictive for well-established species as opposed to new invaders and in areas with steeper environmental gradients.

These equations yield useful estimates of effective population size, as they require a single sample in time. As these estimates of effective population size are now commonly used on a variety of genomic data, from arrays of single nucleotide polymorphisms to whole genome data, some authors have investigated their bias through simulation studies and proposed corrections for different mating systems. However, the cause of the bias remains elusive. Here, we show the problems of using LD as a statistical measure and, analogously, the problems in estimating effective population size from such measure. For that purpose, we compare three commonly used approaches with a transition probability-based method that we develop here. It provides an exact computation of LD. We show here that the bias in the estimates of LD and effective population size are partly due to low-frequency markers, tightly linked markers or to a small total number of crossovers per generation. These biases, however, do not decrease when increasing sample size or using unlinked markers. Our results show the issues of such measures of effective population based on LD and suggest which of the method here studied should be used in empirical studies as well as the optimal distance between markers for such estimates.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  32,10.1111/jeb.13411     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),effective population size;linkage disequilibrium;recombination;transition probability matrix;FINITE;FIXATION;GENES;LOCUS;MODEL;Linkage Disequilibrium;Population Density,,

LocationsGlobal.        MethodsThrough literature search we compiled 97 habitat island datasets. For each we analysed the form of the island species-area relationship (ISAR) and several versions of species accumulation curve (SAC), giving priority to a randomized form (Ran-SAC). Having established the validity of the power model, we compared the slopes (z-values) between the ISAR and the SAC for each dataset. We used boosted regression tree and simulation analyses to investigate the effect of nestedness and other variables in driving observed differences in z-values between ISARs and SACs.        ResultsThe Ran-SAC was steeper than the ISAR in 77% of datasets. The differences were primarily driven by the degree of nestedness, although other variables (e.g. the number of islands in a dataset) were also important.

Such an additional temporal component has the promise of providing improved power for the estimation of natural selection. Over the last decade, statistical approaches for the detection and quantification of natural selection from ancient DNA (aDNA) data have been developed. However, most of the existing methods do not allow us to estimate the timing of natural selection along with its strength, which is key to understanding the evolution and persistence of organismal diversity. Additionally, most methods ignore the fact that natural populations are almost always structured, which can result in an overestimation of the effect of natural selection. To address these issues, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework for the inference of natural selection and gene migration from aDNA data with Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, co-estimating both timing and strength of natural selection and gene migration. Such an advance enables us to infer drivers of natural selection and gene migration by correlating genetic evolution with potential causes such as the changes in the ecological context in which an organism has evolved. The performance of our procedure is evaluated through extensive simulations, with its utility shown with an application to ancient chicken samples.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  35,10.1111/1755-0998.13553,"blockwise particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings;continent-island model;gene migration;hidden Markov model;natural selection;Wright-Fisher diffusion;WRIGHT-FISHER DIFFUSION;TIME-SERIES DATA;ALLELE AGE;PATTERNS;LOCI;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Selection, Genetic;Chickens",,

Taxonomic sufficiency concerns the use of higher-taxon diversity as a surrogate for species diversity. It represents a fast and cost-effective method to assess community responses to natural and anthropogenic environmental drivers. In spite of the potential applications of using higher taxa as surrogates for species, little research has been carried out to determine the underlying reasons that might make taxonomic surrogacy effective for detecting diversity changes.        2. Here, we determine whether the effectiveness of higher taxa as species surrogates relies mostly on taxonomic relatedness of species (i. e. the relative closeness of species in the Linnaean taxonomic hierarchy) or depends simply on the numerical ratio between species and higher taxa (i. e. the degree of species aggregation). We reviewed the current literature on taxonomic sufficiency to check for any correlation between the effectiveness of higher taxa and the degree of species aggregation across different types of organisms. Tests based on random simulations from diverse marine mollusc assemblages were also carried out to ascertain whether the ability of higher taxa to detect variation in the multivariate structure of assemblages depended on the degree of species aggregation.        3. Mollusc data showed that information loss and the ensuing decrease in statistical power to detect natural or human-driven changes in assemblages at higher taxonomic levels depend on the degree of species aggregation, rather than on the taxonomic resolution employed. Analyses of the literature suggested that such outcomes could be generalizable to a wide range of organisms and environmental settings.        4. Our findings do not support the idea of a direct relationship between taxonomic relatedness and ecological similarity among species. This indicates that taxonomic ranks higher than species may not provide ecologically meaningful information, because higher taxa can behave as random groups of species unlikely to convey consistent responses to natural or human-driven environmental changes.        5. Synthesis and applications. Surrogates of species-level information can be based on the 'highest practicable aggregation' of species, irrespective of their taxonomic relatedness. Our findings cast doubt on static taxonomical groupings, legitimizing the use of alternative ways to aggregate species to maximize the use of species surrogacy.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  69     Total Times Cited:  74     Cited Reference Count:  56,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02096.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),biodiversity;conservation;higher-taxon approach;impact assessment;marine molluscs;natural environmental variations;phylogenetic relatedness;taxonomic surrogates;taxonomy;SIEVE MESH-SIZE;PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL;NICHE CONSERVATISM;BETA DIVERSITY;HIGHER TAXA;LEVEL;BIODIVERSITY;SUFFICIENCY;RICHNESS;RESOLUTION,,

To achieve this, we generated thousands of SNPs from 47 red-tailed black cockatoo (Calyptorhychus banksii) traditional museum samples (i.e. samples that were not collected with the primary intent of DNA analysis) and 113 fresh tissue samples (cryopreserved liver/muscle) using a restriction site-associated DNA marker approach (DArTseq((TM))). Thousands of SNPs were successfully generated from most of the traditional museum samples (with a mean age of 44 years, ranging from 5 to 123 years), although 38% did not provide useful data. These SNPs exhibited higher error rates and contained significantly more missing data compared with SNPs from fresh tissue samples, likely due to considerable DNA fragmentation. However, based on simulation results, the level of genotyping error had a negligible effect on inference of population structure in this species. We did identify a bias towards low diversity SNPs in older samples that appears to compromise temporal inferences of genetic diversity.

The most common methods to estimate detection probability during avian point-count surveys involve recording a distance between the survey point and individual birds detected during the survey period. Accurately measuring or estimating distance is an important assumption of these methods; however, this assumption is rarely tested in the context of aural avian point-count surveys.        Aims. We expand on recent bird-simulation studies to document the error associated with estimating distance to calling birds in a wetland ecosystem.        Methods. We used two approaches to estimate the error associated with five surveyor's distance estimates between the survey point and calling birds, and to determine the factors that affect a surveyor's ability to estimate distance.        Key results. We observed biased and imprecise distance estimates when estimating distance to simulated birds in a point-count scenario ((x) over bar (error) = -9m, s.d.(error) = 47m) and when estimating distances to real birds during field trials ((x) over bar (error) = 39m, s.d.(error) = 79 m). The amount of bias and precision in distance estimates differed among surveyors; surveyors with more training and experience were less biased and more precise when estimating distance to both real and simulated birds. Three environmental factors were important in explaining the error associated with distance estimates, including the measured distance from the bird to the surveyor, the volume of the call and the species of bird. Surveyors tended to make large overestimations to birds close to the survey point, which is an especially serious error in distance sampling.        Conclusions. Our results suggest that distance-estimation error is prevalent, but surveyor training may be the easiest way to reduce distance-estimation error.        Implications. The present study has demonstrated how relatively simple field trials can be used to estimate the error associated with distance estimates used to estimate detection probability during avian point-count surveys. Evaluating distance-estimation errors will allow investigators to better evaluate the accuracy of avian density and trend estimates. Moreover, investigators who evaluate distance-estimation errors could employ recently developed models to incorporate distance-estimation error into analyses. We encourage further development of such models, including the inclusion of such models into distance-analysis software.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  45,10.1071/WR11161     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),detection probability;distance error;distance sampling;marsh birds;ESTIMATING DETECTION PROBABILITY;POINT-COUNT SURVEYS;SOUND-TRANSMISSION;ABUNDANCE;DENSITY;VEGETATION;INDEXES,,

This species represents a main threat for crops and biodiversity and a pest for the pig industry due to the rapid expansion of the African swine fever. Because of its peculiar life history traits, population control programmes and recreational hunting are usually unable to effectively reduce the number of wild boars. Therefore, a reliable approach based on appropriate, cost-effective, monitoring methodologies is urgently required. Effective monitoring should adopt effective sampling strategies, otherwise the detection of population trends can be erroneous and resulting in a mismatch of appropriate management actions. First, we review the status-of-the-art of wildlife monitoring with a special focus on wild boar and feral pigs. Then, we show that nocturnal distance sampling, carried out using thermal cameras, can be an effective monitoring technique for wild boar population assessment regardless of the characteristics of the sampled area. Using data from multiple surveys performed in four study areas in Italy, characterised by contrasting topography, habitats and level of environmental visibility, we found that the estimate of precision is generally good and almost independent of landscape conditions. A simple method to estimate visibility, which may empirically help wildlife managers to design effective nocturnal distance sampling surveys, is proposed. The bias of our population estimates is evaluated using simulations showing that in some areas the estimate is unbiased, while in others there is the tendency towards a negative bias.

The measurement of animal density may take advantage of recent technological achievements in wildlife video recording. Fostering the theoretical links between the patterns depicted by cameras and absolute density is required to exploit this potential.        2. We explore the applicability of the Hutchinson-Waser's postulate (i.e. when animal density is stationary at a given temporal and spatial scale, the absolute density is given by the average number of animals counted per frame), which is a counterintuitive statement for most ecologists and managers who are concerned with counting the same individual more than once. We aimed to reconcile such scepticism for animals displaying home range behaviour.        3. The specific objectives of this paper are to generalize the Hutchinson-Waser's postulate for animals displaying home range behaviour and to propose a Bayesian implementation to estimate density from counts per frame using video cameras.        4. Accuracy and precision of the method was evaluated by means of computer simulation experiments. Specifically, six animal archetypes displaying well-contrasted movement features were considered. The simulation results demonstrate that density could be accurately estimated after an affordable sampling effort (i.e. number of cameras and deployment time) for a great number of animals across taxa.        5. The proposed method may complement other conventional methods for estimating animal density. The major advantages are that identifying an animal at the individual level and precise knowledge on how animals move are not needed, and that density can be estimated in a single survey. The method can accommodate conventional camera trapping data. The major limitations are related to some implicit assumptions of the underlying model: the home range centres should be homogeneously distributed, the detection probability within the area surveyed by the camera should be known, and animals should move independently to one another.

Movement data provide a window - often our only window - into the cognitive, social and biological processes that underlie the behavioural ecology of animals in the wild. Robust methods for identifying and interpreting distinct modes of movement behaviour are of great importance, but complicated by the fact that movement data are complex, multivariate and dependent. Many different approaches to exploratory analysis of movement have been developed to answer similar questions, and practitioners are often at a loss for how to choose an appropriate tool for a specific question.        2. We apply and compare four methodological approaches: first passage time (FPT), Bayesian partitioning of Markov models (BPMM), behavioural change point analysis (BCPA) and a fitted multistate random walk (MRW) to three simulated tracks and two animal trajectories - a sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) tracked for 12 h and a wolf (Canis lupus) tracked for 1 year.        3. The simulations - in which, respectively, velocity, tortuosity and spatial bias change highlight the sensitivity of all methods to model misspecification. Methods that do not account for autocorrelation in the movement variables lead to spurious change points, while methods that do not account for spatial bias completely miss changes in orientation.        4. When applied to the animal data, the methods broadly agree on the structure of the movement behaviours. Important discrepancies, however, reflect differences in the assumptions and nature of the outputs. Important trade-offs are between the strength of the a priori assumptions (low in BCPA, high in MRW), complexity of output (high in the BCPA, low in the BPMM and MRW) and explanatory potential (highest in the MRW).        5. The animal track analysis suggests some general principles for the exploratory analysis of movement data, including ways to exploit the strengths of the various methods.

Occupancy depends on the size of the site selected, with smaller sites leading to lower occupancy for a given area and number of individuals present. At low animal density, occupancy scales approximately linearly with the area of sites, but at very high density, occupancy asymptotes at 1.0 across all site sizes. Even small amounts of movement lead to bias in estimates of occupancy and detectability, and the typical size of bird home ranges can lead to highly biased parameters. Moreover, variation in home range size over time or across habitats can lead to varying degrees of bias. Because of the potential for large bias in occupancy estimates, and their sensitivity to behaviors of birds (e.g., home range size), we recommend against applying current occupancy models to bird point-count data.

Biological processes exhibit complex temporal dependencies due to the sequential nature of allocation decisions in organisms' life cycles, feedback loops and two-way causality. Consequently, longitudinal data often contain cross-lags: the predictor variable depends on the response variable of the previous time step. Although statisticians have warned that regression models that ignore such covariate endogeneity in time series are likely to be inappropriate, this has received relatively little attention in biology. Furthermore, the resulting degree of estimation bias remains largely unexplored.        2. We use a graphical model and numerical simulations to understand why and how regression models that ignore cross-lags can be biased, and how this bias depends on the length and number of time series. Ecological and evolutionary examples are provided to illustrate that cross-lags may be more common than is typically appreciated and that they occur in functionally different ways.        3. We show that routinely used regression models that ignore cross-lags are asymptotically unbiased. However, this offers little relief, as for most realistically feasible lengths of time-series conventional methods are biased. Furthermore, collecting time series on multiple subjects-such as populations, groups or individuals-does not help to overcome this bias when the analysis focusses on within-subject patterns (often the pattern of interest). Simulations, a literature search and a real-world empirical example together suggest that approaches that ignore cross-lags are likely biased in the direction opposite to the sign of the cross-lag (e.g. towards detecting density dependence of vital rates and against detecting life-history trade-offs and benefits of group living). Next, we show that multivariate (e.g. structural equation) models can dynamically account for cross-lags, and simultaneously address additional bias induced by measurement error, but only if the analysis considers multiple time series.        4. We provide guidance on how to identify a cross-lag and subsequently specify it in a multivariate model, which can be far from trivial. Our tutorials with data and R code of the worked examples provide step-by-step instructions on how to perform such analyses.        5. Our study offers insights into situations in which cross-lags can bias analysis of ecological and evolutionary time series and suggests that adopting dynamical models can be important, as this directly affects our understanding of population regulation, the evolution of life histories and cooperation, and possibly many other topics. Determining how strong estimation bias due to ignoring covariate endogeneity has been in the ecological literature requires further study, also because it may interact with other sources of bias.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  55,10.1111/1365-2656.13572,covariate endogeneity;density dependence;group living;Malurus elegans;measurement error;structural equation model;time-series length;trade-off;MODELS;REGRESSION;BEHAVIOR;CONSEQUENCES;EVOLUTION;BENEFITS;ERROR;COSTS,,

One proven method used to quantify carnivore density, especially species difficult to individually identify from photos taken by camera traps, utilizes overlapping home ranges of individual animals in the study area. This method, however, may be particularly prone to residency and extrapolation biases. Residency bias occurs when the reference area for the density estimate is incorrect, and extrapolation bias occurs when scaling a density to a different spatial extent than that of the study area upon which the estimate was based. We used a simulation approach based on GPS locations to diagnose potential biases in published densities of pumas Puma concolor from Patagonia, where Franklin et al. 1999 (Biol. Conserv. 90: 33-40) reported 'minimum' densities of 6 and 30 pumas per 100 km(2), and Elbroch and Wittmer 2012a (Mammal. Biol. 77: 377-384) reported densities of 3.4 pumas per 100 km(2). Using GPS data from the latter study we tested methods described in Franklin et al. (1999) and compared their outcomes. Our results showed that density estimates that do not account for residency bias resulted in severely inflated density estimates. Our findings also indicated that actual densities from Franklin et al. (1999) might have been an order of magnitude lower than reported, and therefore consistent with puma densities reported across the range of the species. Both studies introduced extrapolation bias by translating linearly their estimates to new spatial extents, although the magnitude of this bias was much less than that of residency bias. Our results underscore the need for rigorous accounting of residential space in estimating population density, and highlight the scale-dependency of density estimates.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  47,10.2981/wlb.12100     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),SPATIAL ECOLOGY;POPULATION;MANAGEMENT;DISPERSAL;MOVEMENTS;ABUNDANCE;DYNAMICS;BEHAVIOR;DESIGN;SIZE;Bias (Epidemiology),,

Here, we pay specific attention to various forms of censoring and truncation that present challenges for telemetry-based monitoring of survival. We use simulations to assess how uncertainty about times of death and imperfect detection probabilities affect Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. We then treat monitoring of threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in west-central Alberta as a case study to test for potential effects of non-random right censoring and interval censoring on survival estimates. We report that monitoring frequency (e.g., daily vs. monthly) and associated uncertainty about the exact time of death do not inherently induce bias on Kaplan-Meier point estimates of survival nor affect estimates of variance. Removing individuals from the at-risk pool during intervals for which they were not detected did induce a negative bias on resulting survival estimates when the probability of detection was independent of the animals' fates. We recommend using subsequent detections to impute animals' fates during missed intervals in such cases when all animals' fates are eventually known or permanently right censored and when missed detections are not related to changes in mortality risk. Although some assumptions remain difficult to test and of continued concern, we find no evidence of biases in the methodology of Alberta's woodland caribou monitoring program. Our results lend credence to recent evidence of widespread declines in woodland caribou populations across the province.

Therefore, long-term monitoring programs need to evaluate sources of bias to ensure that objectives of the program can be met. Although trend estimation is possible using biased estimators, population status, and management decisions can be sensitive to random and systematic heterogeneity in the observation process. For example, standard methods used to monitor reproductive attempts at bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nests fail to quantify observation error. We used bald eagle nest surveys from 3 national parks in Alaska, USA, to examine their ability to accurately estimate nesting attempts and hypothesized that our ability to perfectly observe nesting activity was related to the timing of the survey relative to peak nest attendance by eagles. We therefore, developed 3 scenarios that evaluated our ability to correctly identify nesting status metrics: peak nesting remained unchanged (observed variation scenario), reduced ability to predict peak nest attendance (high heterogeneity scenario), and peak nest attendance occurred earlier than the survey window (low detection scenario). Eagle nest attendance was consistently underestimated using native estimators, but productivity (predicted no. chicks/nesting attempt) was not affected by imperfect detection. All scenarios showed that using replicate observations to model imperfect detection corrected estimator bias for nest attendance and improved the estimator precision for both metrics. Our study demonstrates that imperfect observation of bald eagle nesting activity using standard methods results in estimator bias and reduced precision if not corrected. Further, our simulations show that changes in observation conditions can affect estimator bias and precision, which is an important consideration for long-term monitoring programs. Therefore, formally modeling imperfect detection should be completed for monitoring programs designed to use nesting status to inform management or conservation decisions.

Analyses based on utilization distributions (UDs) have been ubiquitous in animal space use studies, largely because they are computationally straightforward and relatively easy to employ. Conventional applications of resource utilization functions (RUFs) suggest that estimates of UDs can be used as response variables in a regression involving spatial covariates of interest. It has been claimed that contemporary implementations of RUFs can yield inference about resource selection, although to our knowledge, an explicit connection has not been described. We explore the relationships between RUFs and resource selection functions from a hueristic and simulation perspective. We investigate several sources of potential bias in the estimation of resource selection coefficients using RUFs (e.g. the spatial covariance modelling that is often used in RUF analyses). Our findings illustrate that RUFs can, in fact, serve as approximations to RSFs and are capable of providing inference about resource selection, but only with some modification and under specific circumstances. Using real telemetry data as an example, we provide guidance on which methods for estimating resource selection may be more appropriate and in which situations. In general, if telemetry data are assumed to arise as a point process, then RSF methods may be preferable to RUFs; however, modified RUFs may provide less biased parameter estimates when the data are subject to location error.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  40     Total Times Cited:  40     Cited Reference Count:  25,10.1111/1365-2656.12080     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),kernel density estimation;space use;spatial statistics;utilization distribution;MODELS;DISTRIBUTIONS;ABSENCE,,

Highly polymorphic (e.g. microsatellites) and genomic-wide (e.g. SNPs) markers provide sufficient information to assign individuals to their populations or parents of origin and thereby to estimate directly m in a way similar to MRR. Such direct estimates of current migration rates are particularly useful in understanding the ecology and microevolution of wild populations and in managing the populations in the future. In this study, I proposed and implemented, in the software MigEst, a likelihood method to use marker-based parentage assignments in jointly estimating m and candidate parent sampling proportions (x) in a subset of populations, investigated its power and accuracy using data simulated in various scenarios of population properties (e.g. the actual m, number, size and differentiation of populations) and sampling properties (e.g. the numbers of sampled parent candidates, offspring and markers), compared it with the population assignment approach implemented in the software BayesAss and demonstrated its usefulness by analysing a microsatellite data set from three natural populations of Brazilian bats. Simulations showed that MigEst provides unbiased and accurate estimates of m and performs better than BayesAss except when populations are highly differentiated with very small and ecologically insignificant migration rates.

We tested an innovative approach where prophylaxis is replaced with artificial infestation of the fish. Twenty-nine sea trout post-smolts were caught in a farming-free area in southern Norway and half the fish were artificially infested with lice. Survival and behavior of individual fish was investigated using acoustic telemetry. Furthermore, salinity values were extracted from an hydrodynamical model simulation and connected to individual 3D positions. Results from this pilot study show consistent trends in behavioral differences between artificially infested and control fish. All fish that died or prematurely returned to freshwater were artificially infested fish, although results were not statistically significant. Besides, power analysis confirmed the limitations of this small pilot study for delivering statistically significant inferences. We found also indications of artificially infested fish remaining in shallower waters and within shorter distance to low salinity habitats, but only differences in modelled salinity values were statistically significant.

Most pipelines yielded similar SFS at 8x depth, but only a genotype likelihood based pipeline performed similarly at low sequencing depth (2-4x). We compared the RADseq SFS with medium-depth (similar to 13x) shotgun sequencing of eight overlapping samples, revealing that the RADseq SFS was persistently slightly skewed towards rare and invariant alleles. Using simulations and human data we confirm that this is expected when there is allelic dropout (AD) in the RADseq data. AD in the RADseq data caused a heterozygosity deficit of similar to 16%, which dropped to similar to 5% after filtering AD.

Although existing algorithms, such as Lasso, empirical Bayesian Lasso (EBlasso) and elastic net (EN) are available to infer such QTL models, more powerful methods are highly desirable to detect more QTLs in the presence of correlated QTLs. We developed a novel empirical Bayesian EN (EBEN) algorithm for multiple QTL mapping that inherits the efficiency of our previously developed EBlasso algorithm. Simulation results demonstrated that EBEN provided higher power of detection and almost the same false discovery rate compared with EN and EBlasso. Particularly, EBEN can identify correlated QTLs that the other two algorithms may fail to identify. When analyzing a real dataset, EBEN detected more effects than EN and EBlasso. EBEN provides a useful tool for inferring high-dimensional sparse model in multiple QTL mapping and other applications. An R software package 'EBEN' implementing the EBEN algorithm is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  22     Total Times Cited:  23     Cited Reference Count:  32,10.1038/hdy.2014.79     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),MARKERS;LASSO;REGRESSION;REGULARIZATION;SHRINKAGE;SELECTION;Elasticity,,

Many studies use the program structure combined with the Delta K method to identify the most probable number of populations (K). We recently found K = 2 was identified more often when studies used Delta K compared to studies that did not. We suggested two reasons for this: hierarchical population structure leads to underestimation, or the Delta K method does not evaluate K = 1 causing an overestimation. The present contribution aims to develop a better understanding of the limits of the method using one, two and three population simulations across migration scenarios. From these simulations we identified the ""best K"" using model likelihood and Delta K. Our findings show that mean probability plots and Delta K are unable to resolve the correct number of populations once migration rate exceeds 0.005. We also found a strong bias towards selecting K = 2 using the Delta K method. We used these data to identify the range of values where the Delta K statistic identifies a value of K that is not well supported. Finally, using the simulations and a review of empirical data, we found that the magnitude of Delta K corresponds to the level of divergence between populations. Based on our findings, we suggest researchers should use the Delta K method cautiously; they need to report all relevant data, including the magnitude of Delta K, and an estimate of connectivity for the research community to assess whether meaningful genetic structure exists within the context of management and conservation.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  38     Total Times Cited:  38     Cited Reference Count:  35,10.1111/mec.15374     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),F-ST;genetic structure;migration rate;population structure;Delta K;POPULATION-STRUCTURE;COMPUTER-PROGRAM;R-PACKAGE;INFERENCE;DIFFERENTIATION;IDENTIFICATION;PERFORMANCE;ASSIGNMENT;CLUSTERS;SOFTWARE,,

It computes a number of statistics summarizing the performance in SNP calling, including the recovery, sensitivity and false discovery rate for heterozygous and homozygous SNP genotypes. Pipeliner can be used to answer many practical questions, for example, for a limited amount of NGS effort, how many more reliable SNPs can be detected by doubling coverage and halving sample size or what is the false discovery rate provided by different SNP calling algorithms and options. Pipeliner thus allows researchers to carefully plan their study's sampling design and compare the suitability of alternative bioinformatics approaches for their specific study systems.

First, a new model transformation was used to whiten the covariance matrix of polygenic matrix K and environmental noise. Using the transferred model, Kruskal-Wallis test along with least angle regression was then used to select all the markers that were potentially associated with the trait. Finally, all the selected markers were placed into multi-locus model, these effects were estimated by empirical Bayes, and all the nonzero effects were further identified by a likelihood ratio test for true QTN detection. This method, named pKWmEB, was validated by a series of Monte Carlo simulation studies. As a result, pKWmEB effectively controlled false positive rate, although a less stringent significance criterion was adopted. More importantly, pKWmEB retained the high power of Kruskal-Wallis test, and provided QTN effect estimates.

Most studies of mating preferences assay mate choice using either a no choice or a binary choice design. Binary choice trials typically employ either an artificial signal or some fixed difference (e.g. colour or size) between the signalling individuals. Although statistically more powerful than no choice designs, such experiments cannot be used to detect stabilizing preference. Further, the use of artificial signals is problematic because signal components tend to be varied in isolation, and hence do not reflect natural variation. Here, we present a new method that uses natural variation among individuals in choice trials to determine if mating preference is absent, directional, and/or stabilizing. The protocol is tested using simulation and shown to be robust to the preference function, to have the required statistical power, to be unbiased in almost all cases, and to give confidence regions that modestly overestimate the desired 95% criterion.

We demonstrate via simulation that MECCA has considerable power to choose among single versus multiple evolutionary rate models, and thus can be used to test hypotheses about changes in the rate of trait evolution across an incomplete tree of life. We finally apply MECCA to an empirical example of body size evolution in carnivores, and show that there is no evidence for an elevated rate of body size evolution in the pinnipeds relative to terrestrial carnivores.

Existing methods for estimating these parameters from cross-sectional population data using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) ignore information about the genealogy of sampled HIV sequences, which has the potential to cause systematic bias and overestimate certainty. Here, we describe an integrated approach, validated through extensive simulations, which combines genealogical inference and epidemiological modelling, to estimate rates of CTL escape and reversion in HIV epitopes. We show that there is substantial uncertainty about rates of viral escape and reversion from cross-sectional data, which arises from the inherent stochasticity in the evolutionary process. By application to empirical data, we find that point estimates of rates from a previously published ODE model and the integrated approach presented here are often similar, but can also differ several-fold depending on the structure of the genealogy. The model-based approach we apply provides a framework for the statistical analysis and hypothesis testing of escape and reversion in population data and highlights the need for longitudinal and denser cross-sectional sampling to enable accurate estimate of these key parameters.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  48,10.1098/rspb.2013.0696     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),phylodynamics;HIV;escape;genealogy;peeling;cytotoxic T-lymphocyte;T-LYMPHOCYTE ESCAPE;DNA-SEQUENCES;SELECTION;DISEASE;TRANSMISSION;ADAPTATION;RESPONSES;VARIANTS;PRESSURE;MUTATION;Epitopes,,

However, results from these studies are often difficult to analyze because (1) distributions of offspring per dam rarely follow a normal distribution and (2) proportional paternities are never normally distributed. Previous studies partially account for these limitations by using nonparametric statistics. However, behavioral studies are often plagued by relatively small sample sizes and require a more powerful analytical approach. Here, we develop a new analytical framework for studying fertilization bias. Our Approximate Bayesian Computational (ABC) model overcomes many of the limitations of currently employed methods. We apply our model to analyze the effects of male mating order on paternity success in the brown anole lizard, Anolis sagrei. Using our ABC simulation, we find a marked first-male advantage: first males sired approximately 80 % of the offspring in our study. Next, based on re-analysis of four previously published datasets, we show that traditional statistical methods often over- or underestimate biases related to mating order. Moreover, by comparing our model to more traditional statistical tests, we show that the ABC method is robust to relatively small samples sizes and should therefore be useful for studying mating-order effects in a variety of systems.

Based on their simulations, they concluded that: 1) TITAN is not an effective method for detecting different types of statistical thresholds in trend lines, 2) permutation results in highly significant p-values even for splits that are not thresholds, and 3) coincident change points may arise as an artifact of inaccuracies, imprecision, and systematic bias in both change-point estimation and TITAN's bootstrap. The critique raises some important concerns, but because of significant misunderstanding, it is based on analyses that violate basic assumptions of both TITAN and indicator species analysis (IndVal), and thus, constitutes a straw man that cannot be used to evaluate their performance. We demonstrate that the critique: 1) fundamentally misrepresents TITAN's primary goals; 2) simulates taxon abundances based on unrealistic statistical models that fail to represent important empirical patterns present in Cuffney and Qian's own published data sets (i.e., negative binomial distributions, frequent absences a function of the predictor); 3) tests TITAN's ability to identify breaks in trend lines distorted by log-transformation that do not match the greatest change in the simulated response, leading to misinterpretation of expected and previously documented behavior by TITAN as errors; 4) misinterprets TITAN's use of p-values while ignoring diagnostic indices of purity and reliability for identifying robust indicator taxa; and 5) asserts that bootstrapped change-point quantiles in TITAN are too narrow despite published results to the contrary. Last, in contrast to the claim that change-point synchrony may be an artifact of the technique, we show that: 6) analysis of published data using completely independent methods (i.e., scatterplots of abundance data or generalized additive models) also reveals synchrony in the nonlinear decline of numerous taxa in corroboration of TITAN and its underlying conceptual model. Thus, Cuffney and Qian have not identified any serious limitations of TITAN because their critique is based on misinterpretation of TITAN's assumptions and primary objectives.

It is important to carry out some comparative studies on sampling designs so as to get the optimal design. In this study, we used computer simulations to evaluate the performance of five sampling designs to assess population densities of various fishery groups (total fishery species, fishes, shrimps and crabs) in the Yangtze River estuary (YRE), China. The survey designs were simple random sampling, systematic sampling and stratified sampling with three allocation schemes. We found that optimal sampling designs were different depending on the target fishery groups. In general, systematic sampling had higher precision and accuracy for estimating population density compared to simple random sampling and stratified sampling. However, systematic sampling led to the underestimation of population density, where large fluctuations in error rate were observed with increasing sample size during certain seasons. Stratified sampling performed by proportional allocation of sampling efforts or equal allocation of sampling efforts schemes was slightly worse than systematic sampling. However, stratified sampling did not result in overestimation or underestimation of the mean population density. In stratified sampling designs, relative error decreased with increasing sample size. Stratified sampling with optimal criterion of sampling cost did not accurately estimate the population density, and had variable relative error and relative bias, indicating that the accuracy of this method could be increased by identifying reasonable allocation of samples among strata.

For example, a modern workstation can easily handle the computations needed to perform a large-scale genome-wide inheritance-by-descent (IBD) scan, but accurate assessment of the significance of that scan is often hindered by inaccurate approximations and computationally intensive simulation. To address these issues, we developed gLOD-a test of co-segregation that, for large samples, models chromosome-specific IBD statistics as a collection of stationary Gaussian processes. With this simple model, the parametric bootstrap yields an accurate and rapid assessment of significance-the genome-wide corrected P-value.

Based on the Ising model of ferromagnetism, we incorporated neighbor genotypic identity into a regression model, named ""Neighbor GWAS"". Our simulations showed that the effective range of neighbor effects could be estimated using an observed phenotype when the proportion of phenotypic variation explained (PVE) by neighbor effects peaked. The spatial scale of the first nearest neighbors gave the maximum power to detect the causal variants responsible for neighbor effects, unless their effective range was too broad. However, if the effective range of the neighbor effects was broad and minor allele frequencies were low, there was collinearity between the self and neighbor effects. To suppress the false positive detection of neighbor effects, the fixed effect and variance components involved in the neighbor effects should be tested in comparison with a standard GWAS model. We applied neighbor GWAS to field herbivory data from 199 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana and found that neighbor effects explained 8% more of the PVE of the observed damage than standard GWAS.

Among the challenges associated with landscape measurement is identifying the appropriate scale of application, both temporal and spatial. Measurement of landscape patterns in highly-dynamic landscapes is especially challenged by temporal scale selection.        Objectives This short communication focuses on how landscape pattern measurements vary in response to normal variability in a highly-dynamic landscape        Methods For a small agricultural landscape with known crop rotation dynamism sequences, a simulation model provided 30 years of crop rotations. These 30 different landscapes were measured with landscape pattern measurements and the variability of the measurements was assessed.        Results Almost half of the measurement values were outliers, and 12 of the 30 years had at least one outlier landscape pattern measurement value, even though the basis of landscape change was a normative agricultural practice. For a consistent but dynamic landscape, some landscape measurements or simulation years had high variability, demonstrating that inferences from highly-dynamic landscapes need to be based on fine-resolution time steps.        Conclusions The application of landscape pattern measurements continues to be a common method in landscape ecology, and temporal dimensions are key to detecting change and what might be causing or responding to that change. The temporal resolution of change implies that highly-dynamic landscapes require more-frequent sampling, and that comparisons for agricultural landscapes over long time periods requires more than a single temporal endpoint.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  31,10.1007/s10980-019-00823-w     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Temporal scale;Farm practices;FRAGSTATS;Landscape change;Ontario;Rotation,,

The spatial scales of habitat relationships are often unknown, and are expected to follow a multi-scale hierarchy. Typical frequentist or information theoretic approaches often suffer under collinearity in multi-scale studies, fail to converge when models are complex or represent an intractable computational burden when candidate model sets are large.        Our objective was to implement an automated, Bayesian method for inference on the spatial scales of habitat variables that best predict animal abundance.        We introduce Bayesian latent indicator scale selection (BLISS), a Bayesian method to select spatial scales of predictors using latent scale indicator variables that are estimated with reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. BLISS does not suffer from collinearity, and substantially reduces computation time of studies. We present a simulation study to validate our method and apply our method to a case-study of land cover predictors for ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) abundance in Nebraska, USA.        Our method returns accurate descriptions of the explanatory power of multiple spatial scales, and unbiased and precise parameter estimates under commonly encountered data limitations including spatial scale autocorrelation, effect size, and sample size. BLISS outperforms commonly used model selection methods including stepwise and AIC, and reduces runtime by 90%.        Given the pervasiveness of scale-dependency in ecology, and the implications of mismatches between the scales of analyses and ecological processes, identifying the spatial scales over which species are integrating habitat information is an important step in understanding species-habitat relationships. BLISS is a widely applicable method for identifying important spatial scales, propagating scale uncertainty, and testing hypotheses of scaling relationships.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  24     Total Times Cited:  25     Cited Reference Count:  58,10.1007/s10980-017-0575-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Abundance;Bayesian model selection;Habitat selection;Model uncertainty;Spatial scale;MULTIPLE SPATIAL SCALES;MODEL SELECTION;BREEDING BIRDS;AUTOCORRELATION;DISTRIBUTIONS;PREFERENCES;DEPENDENCE;ECOLOGY;CLIMATE;PATTERN;Bayes Theorem,,

The utility of the method was challenged with three simulated data sets, the Genetic Association Workshop-15 (GAW15) rheumatoid arthritis data set, a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and atherosclerosis data set from a mouse QT locus study, and the 1000 Genomes data.

In these studies, phenotype vectors containing two and three constituent multivariate normally distributed QTs were used and the KWII was found to be effective at detecting GEI associated with the phenotype. High KWII values were observed for variables and variable combinations associated with the syndrome phenotype compared with uninformative variables not associated with the phenotype. The KWII values for the phenotype-associated combinations increased monotonically with increasing effect size values. The KWII also exhibited utility in simulations with non-linear dependence between the constituent QTs. Analysis of the HDL and atherosclerosis data set indicated that the simultaneous analysis of both phenotypes identified interactions not detected in the analysis of the individual traits.

The authors suggest application of a kinematic method for diagnostics of agricultural machinery drive trains during their operation; this method implies analysis of position changes and movement of mating parts: wear of parts and backlash of mating drive parts may be assessed by establishment of geometric parameters of diagnostics (linear and angular movements). The total transmission backlash may be established by dynamic torque appearing in transient states of mechanism operation; such total backlash characterizes dynamic errors in movement of an outlet member, which is a result of dependence of equivalent moment of inertia and drag torque from the velocity transmission error. Such diagnostics of potato harvester transmission allows checking of backlashes in separate sections of the chain, as well as assessment of quality of its components adjustment and maintenance.

QTLs detected from such an experiment are important for us to understand the genetic mechanisms governing a complex trait, but may not be directly relevant to plant breeding if they are not detected from the breeding population where selection is targeting for. QTLs segregating in one population may not necessarily segregate in another population. To facilitate marker-assisted selection, QTLs must be detected from the very population which the selection is targeting. However, selected breeding populations often have depleted genetic variation with small population sizes, resulting in low power in detecting useful QTLs. On the other hand, if selection is effective, loci controlling the selected trait will deviate from the expected Mendelian segregation ratio. In this study, we proposed to detect QTLs in selected breeding populations via the detection of marker segregation distortion in either a single population or multiple populations using the same selection scheme. Simulation studies showed that QTL can be detected in strong selected populations with selected population sizes as small as 25 plants. We applied the new method to detect QTLs in two breeding populations of rice selected for high grain yield. Seven QTLs were identified, four of which have been validated in advanced generations in a follow-up study. Cloned genes in the vicinity of the four QTLs were also reported in the literatures.

In rivers, the number of either distal (e.g. in headwater streams) or confluent (e.g. in mainstems) locations can be increased along with their branching complexity. Distal- or confluent-spatial locations can result in fewer or greater corridor linkages that can alter genetic divergence at the metapopulation scale. These mechanisms underlying the resulting genetic structuring remain poorly understood at the metapopulation scale, particularly in terms of the roles of species-specific dispersal traits. The objective of this study was to mechanistically understand how branching complexity can simultaneously influence genetic divergence in opposite directions. Location North-eastern Japan. Methods To evaluate the integrated influences of network complexity and species dispersal on genetic divergence among populations at the catchment scale, we modelled metapopulation genetic dynamics under a Bayesian inference framework by adapting empirical genetic data from four macroinvertebrate species. Simulations were then performed using empirical and virtual species characteristics on virtual river networks. Results Our simulation experiments showed that both greater landscape connectivity (resulting from shorter watercourse distance) and greater isolation of distal locations occurred in the more-branched river networks. These two spatial features have negative and positive influences on genetic divergence, with their relative importance varying among different species and dispersal characteristics. Specifically, genetic divergence at the metapopulation scale increased for species having higher downstream-biased dispersal but decreased for species having higher upstream-biased dispersal. Distal populations (e.g. in headwaters) have higher genetic independence when downstream-biased asymmetry is higher. Main conclusions We found a strong association between species dispersal and evolutionary processes such as gene flow and genetic drift. This association mediates the pervasive influences of branching complexity on genetic divergence in the metapopulation. It also highlights the importance of considering species dispersal patterns when developing management strategies in the face of rapid environmental change scenarios.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  47,10.1111/ddi.13160,Bayesian inference;distribution;fractal geometry;habitat fragmentation;isolation by distance;landscape complexity;macroinvertebrates;SPATIAL-PATTERNS;OVERLAND DISPERSAL;AQUATIC INSECTS;IN-STREAM;DIVERSITY;FLOW;FRAGMENTATION;CONSERVATION;ARCHITECTURE;RESTORATION;Genetic Variation,,

This type of truncation is worrisome because it can lead to incorrect predictions e.g., when projecting to future climatic conditions belonging to the species niche but unavailable in the calibration area. Data from citizen-science programs, species range maps or atlases covering the full species range can be used to capture those parts of the species' niche that are missing regionally. However, these data usually are too coarse or too biased to support regional management. Here, we aim to (1) demonstrate how varying degrees of spatial niche truncation affect SDMs projections when calibrated with climatically truncated regional data sets and (2) test the performance of different methods to harness information from larger-scale data sets presenting different spatial resolutions to solve the spatial niche truncation problem. We used simulations to compare the performance of the different methods, and applied them to a real data set to predict the future distribution of a plant species (Potentilla aurea) in Switzerland. SDMs calibrated with geographically restricted data sets expectedly provided biased predictions when projected outside the calibration area or time period. Approaches integrating information from larger-scale data sets using hierarchical data integration methods usually reduced this bias. However, their performance varied depending on the level of spatial niche truncation and how data were combined. Interestingly, while some methods (e.g., data pooling, downscaling) performed well on both simulated and real data, others (e.g., those based on a Poisson point process) performed better on real data, indicating a dependency of model performance on the simulation process (e.g., shape of simulated response curves). Based on our results, we recommend to use different data integration methods and, whenever possible, to make a choice depending on model performance. In any case, an ensemble modeling approach can be used to account for uncertainty in how niche truncation is accounted for and identify areas where similarities/dissimilarities exist across methods.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  77,10.1002/eap.2427,atlas;Bayesian inference;citizen science data;data resolution;geographic extent;multi-scale models;national inventories;Poisson point process;range maps;species response curves;DISTRIBUTION MODELS;CLIMATE-CHANGE;POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTIONS;SAMPLE-SIZE;CONSERVATION;RANGE;BIAS;FUTURE;UNCERTAINTY;ECOLOGY,,

We examined forest biomass maps of Barro Colorado Island (50 ha), Panama (50 000 km(2)), and South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia (3 x 10(6)-11 x 10(6) km(2)).        The results showed that around 100 plots (1-25 ha each) are necessary for continent-wide biomass estimations if the sampled plots are randomly distributed. However, locations of current inventory plots often do not meet this requirement, for example, as their sampling design is based on spatial transects among climatic gradients. We show that these nonrandom locations lead to a much higher sampling intensity being required (up to 54 000 plots for accurate biomass estimates for South America). The number of sample plots needed can be reduced using large distances (5 km) between the plots within transects.        We also applied novel point pattern reconstruction methods to account for aggregation of inventory plots in known forest plot networks. The results implied that current plot networks can have clustered structures that reduce the accuracy of large-scale estimates of forest biomass if no further statistical approach is applied. To establish more reliable biomass predictions across South American tropical forests, we recommend more spatially randomly distributed inventory plots (minimum: 100 plots) and ensuring that the analyses of inventory plot data consider their spatial characteristics. The precision of forest attribute estimates depends on the sampling intensity and strategy.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  40,10.5194/bg-17-1673-2020     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),TROPICAL FOREST;CARBON-DENSITY;FIELD;AMAZON;HETEROGENEITY;DYNAMICS;PATTERNS;BIAS;MAP,,

Environmental variables considered were distance to key habitats, habitat area, temperature, depth, salinity, nutrient concentration, as well as natural and anthropogenic disturbance. We test the significance of associations between these factors and species richness, establish the shape of these relationships and use spatial cross-validation to test the generality of these results. Species-specific environmental associations within these relationships were then tested.        Results: Five environmental variables showed significant associations with species richness, but only two, temperature and depth, proved robust to spatial cross-validation. Temperature was the best performing environmental predictor, showing a unimodal relationship with species richness and optimum temperatures consistent across analytical choices and data sets. Relationships between species richness and other environmental factors were also typically unimodal. Variation in species-specific temperature associations was significant within species richness gradients; with a higher number of species associated with optimal temperatures.        Main conclusions: Temperature represents the dominant environmental predictor of fish species richness identified by our study, showing a hump-shaped curve, peaking at around 27.4 degrees C. This meant that the warmest sites within our study were not necessarily the most species rich. Variation in species thermal niches may play a key role in driving species richness gradients, with significant general positive trend for fish species to occur in locations exhibiting optimum sea surface temperatures.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  47,10.1111/jbi.13044     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),biodiversity;citizen science;coral reef;drivers of fish species richness;ecological sampling simulation;Reef Environmental Education Foundation;sampling bias;species richness estimators;The wider Caribbean Region;GLOBAL PATTERNS;HISTORICAL BIOGEOGRAPHY;REEF FISHES;RICHNESS;BIODIVERSITY;SCALE;PREDICTORS;DIVERSITY;ENERGY;PHYTOPLANKTON;Species Specificity;Military Personnel,,

In particular, sibling analyses are frequently used with three main methods: an historical model using the average colony relatedness, a half-sib/full-sib model, and the more recent animal model. We compared those three methods using experimental and simulated datasets to see which performs the best. Our experimental dataset is composed of 10 colonies with a total sample of 853 workers. All individuals were genotyped to reconstitute the pedigree, and phenotypic traits were measured: labial palpus and wing cubital veins lengths. We also simulated phenotypic datasets with varying levels of heritability, common environment effect, and genetic correlation between traits. The simulation approach showed that the average colony relatedness was highly biased in presence of common environment effect whereas the half-sib/full-sib and the animal model gave reliable estimates of heritability. The animal model provided the greatest precision in genetic correlations. Using this latter method, we found that wing vein lengths had high heritabilities whereas the palpus length had lower heritability due to larger environmental variance and/or measurement error.

For example, observing animals in the wild can difficult when animals move, hide, or cannot be closely approached. We consider time series of events recorded in conditions where events are occasionally missed by observers or observational devices. These time series are not restricted to behavioral protocols, but can be any cyclic or recurring process where discrete outcomes are observed. Undetected events cause biased inferences on the process of interest, and statistical analyses are needed that can identify and correct the compromised detection processes. Missed observations in time series lead to observed time intervals between events at multiples of the true inter-event time, which conveys information on their detection probability. We derive the theoretical probability density function for observed intervals between events that includes a probability of missed detection. Methodology and software tools are provided for analysis of event data with potential observation bias and its removal. The methodology was applied to simulation data and a case study of defecation rate estimation in geese, which is commonly used to estimate their digestive throughput and energetic uptake, or to calculate goose usage of a feeding site from dropping density. Simulations indicate that at a moderate chance to miss arrival events (p=0.3), uncorrected arrival intervals were biased upward by up to a factor 3, while parameter values corrected for missed observations were within 1% of their true simulated value. A field case study shows that not accounting for missed observations leads to substantial underestimates of the true defecation rate in geese, and spurious rate differences between sites, which are introduced by differences in observational conditions. These results show that the derived methodology can be used to effectively remove observational biases in time-ordered event data.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  35,10.1002/ece3.3281     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),fecal output;interval time series;missing data;mixture model;observation protocol;probability of detection;MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD;GAMMA-DISTRIBUTION;FOOD QUALITY,,

However, the few publications that use opportunistic citizen science data to study animal ecology at a habitat level do so without accounting for spatial biases in opportunistic records or using methods that are difficult to generalize. In this study, we explore the biases that exist in opportunistic observations and suggest an approach to correct for them. We first examined the extent of the biases in opportunistic citizen science observations of three wild ungulate species in Norway by comparing them to data from GPS telemetry. We then quantified the extent of the biases by specifying a model of the biases. From the bias model, we sampled available locations within the species' home range. Along with opportunistic observations, we used the corrected availability locations to estimate a resource selection function (RSF). We tested this method with simulations and empirical datasets for the three species. We compared the results of our correction method to RSFs obtained using opportunistic observations without correction and to RSFs using GPS-telemetry data. Finally, we compared habitat suitability maps obtained using each of these models. Opportunistic observations are more affected by human access and visibility than locations derived from GPS telemetry. This has consequences for drawing inferences about species' ecology. Models naively using opportunistic observations in habitat-use studies can result in spurious inferences. However, sampling availability locations based on the spatial biases in opportunistic data improves the estimation of the species' RSFs and predicted habitat suitability maps in some cases. This study highlights the challenges and opportunities of using opportunistic observations in habitat-use studies.

A common implicit assumption is that the sampling design is ignorable and does not need to be formally accounted for in analyses. The analyst assumes data are representative of the desired population and statistical modeling proceeds. However, if data sets from probability and non-probability surveys are combined or unequal selection probabilities are used, the design may be non-ignorable. We outline the use of pseudo-maximum likelihood estimation for site-occupancy models to account for such non-ignorable survey designs. This estimation method accounts for the survey design by properly weighting the pseudo-likelihood equation. In our empirical example, legacy and newer randomly selected locations were surveyed for bats to bridge a historic statewide effort with an ongoing nationwide program. We provide a worked example using bat acoustic detection/non-detection data and show how analysts can diagnose whether their design is ignorable. Using simulations we assessed whether our approach is viable for modeling data sets composed of sites contributed outside of a probability design. Pseudo-maximum likelihood estimates differed from the usual maximum likelihood occupancy estimates for some bat species. Using simulations we show the maximum likelihood estimator of species-environment relationships with non-ignorable sampling designs was biased, whereas the pseudo-likelihood estimator was design unbiased. However, in our simulation study the designs composed of a large proportion of legacy or non-probability sites resulted in estimation issues for standard errors. These issues were likely a result of highly variable weights confounded by small sample sizes (5% or 10% sampling intensity and four revisits). Aggregating data sets from multiple sources logically supports larger sample sizes and potentially increases spatial extents for statistical inferences. Our results suggest that ignoring the mechanism for how locations were selected for data collection (e.g., the sampling design) could result in erroneous model-based conclusions. Therefore, in order to ensure robust and defensible recommendations for evidence-based conservation decision-making, the survey design information in addition to the data themselves must be available for analysts.

Under ongoing climate and biodiversity change, they can greatly facilitate decision-making in conservation and restoration and help designing adequate management strategies for an uncertain future. Here, we review the use of spatially explicit models for decision support and to identify key gaps in current modelling in conservation and restoration. Of 650 reviewed publications, 217 publications had a clear management application and were included in our quantitative analyses. Overall, modelling studies were biased towards static models (79%), towards the species and population level (80%) and towards conservation (rather than restoration) applications (71%). Correlative niche models were the most widely used model type. Dynamic models as well as the gene-to-individual level and the community-to-ecosystem level were underrepresented, and explicit cost optimisation approaches were only used in 10% of the studies. We present a new model typology for selecting models for animal conservation and restoration, characterising model types according to organisational levels, biological processes of interest and desired management applications. This typology will help to more closely link models to management goals. Additionally, future efforts need to overcome important challenges related to data integration, model integration and decision-making. We conclude with five key recommendations, suggesting that wider usage of spatially explicit models for decision support can be achieved by 1) developing a toolbox with multiple, easier-to-use methods, 2) improving calibration and validation of dynamic modelling approaches and 3) developing best-practise guidelines for applying these models. Further, more robust decision-making can be achieved by 4) combining multiple modelling approaches to assess uncertainty, and 5) placing models at the core of adaptive management. These efforts must be accompanied by long-term funding for modelling and monitoring, and improved communication between research and practise to ensure optimal conservation and restoration outcomes.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  118,10.1111/ecog.05787,adaptive management;biodiversity conservation;cost optimisation;ecosystem restoration;global change;predictive models;CLIMATE-CHANGE;BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION;PROTECTED AREAS;COMPLEX;OPTIMIZATION;EXTINCTION;SIMULATION;POPULATION;STRATEGIES;MANAGEMENT;Animal Shells;Animals;Decision Making;Decision Support Techniques,,

This approach, however, is flawed because the real global diversity of many taxa is still largely unknown, especially for rare species. This potential inconsistency of RDMs has not been proved (or disproved) thus far. Here, I use simulation models to explore the efficiency of RDM estimations from incomplete inventories. Location Methods World-wide. Three simple models of species distribution were used: (a) the ""everything is everywhere"" model (unlimited dispersal, i.e., equal probability for a species to occur at every point); (b) the ""environmental selection"" model (each species can occupy only a portion of randomly distributed ""suitable localities"" according to its ecological preferences); and (c) the ""endemicity"" model (most species are restricted to a few regions each). To parameterize these models, the world-wide datasets on ciliates, flagellates and harpacticoid copepods were used. The RDMs were estimated by simulating equal-effort sampling and by varying the full number of species and number of sampled individuals per cell. Results Main conclusions Estimated species richness at any scale was heavily influenced by the sampling effort and was greatly underestimated with small sample sizes. The estimated RDM values also depended on the sampling effort (being either upward or downward biased) but were only slightly influenced by the unrecorded part of real global diversity (ignorance). The predictions of the first two models were generally close to each other but differed noticeably from those of the third model. The relative metrics, albeit influenced by undersampling, are nevertheless more robust to inventory incompleteness than absolute measures and can therefore be a reliable tool in comparative biodiversity studies, even if the true number of species cannot be estimated overall.

However, the ability of individuals to move between habitat patches is notoriously difficult to estimate. One solution is to quantify functional connectivity via realistic individual-based movement models. Such simulation models, however, are difficult to build and even more difficult to parameterize. Here, we use the example of natal little owl (Athene noctua) dispersal to develop a new analysis chain for the calibration of individual-based dispersal models using a hybrid of statistical parameter estimation and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). Specifically, we use locations of 126 radio-tracked juveniles to first estimate habitat utilization by generalized additive models (GAMs) and the biased random bridges (BRB) method. We then include the estimated parameters in a spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM) of little owl dispersal and calibrate further movement parameters using ABC. To derive efficient summary statistics, we use a new dimension reduction method based on random forest (RF) regression. Finally, we use the calibrated IBM to predict the dispersal potential of little owls from local populations in southwestern Germany to suitable habitat patches in northern Switzerland. We show that pre-calibrating habitat preference parameters while inferring movement behavioral parameters via ABC is a computationally efficient solution to obtain a plausible IBM parameterization. We also find that dimension reduction via RF regression outperforms the widely used least squares regression, which we applied as a benchmark approach. Estimated movement parameters for the individuals reveal plausible inter-individual and inter-sexual differences in movement behavior during natal dispersal. In agreement with a sex-biased dispersal distance in little owls, females show longer individual flights and higher directional persistence. Simulations from the fitted model indicate that a (re)colonization of northern Switzerland is generally possible, albeit restricted. We conclude that the presented analysis chain is a sensible work-flow to assess dispersal connectivity across species and ecosystems. It embraces species- and individual-specific behavioral responses to the landscape and allows likelihood-based calibration, despite an irregular sampling design. Our study highlights existing, yet narrow dispersal corridors, which may require enhancements to facilitate a recolonization of little owl habitat patches in northern Switzerland.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  62,10.1002/eap.1873     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Approximate Bayesian Computation;Athene noctua;choosing optimal summary statistics;IBM parametrization;landscape connectivity;movement ecology;APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION;LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY;POPULATION;ECOLOGY;RANGE;DISPERSAL;EVOLUTION;BEHAVIOR;Calibration,,

A common goal of sampling is to estimate density and/or biomass to make inferences about the status and trends of fish populations. One challenge when estimating population size is determining an appropriate site or reach length to sample. In this study, we empirically determined the required length of stream that needs to be sampled, assuming the study design is one site per stream, in order to achieve a desired level of accuracy for brook trout density and biomass estimates in Pennsylvania headwater streams. Long sample reaches (600 m) were chosen on seven first to third order streams and these sites were broken into twelve 50-m subreaches. Each subreach was sampled by removal electrofishing techniques until either five electrofishing passes were completed or no brook trout were captured. The total density and biomass of brook trout over all 50-m subreaches was considered the ""true"" density and biomass for the entire reach. We then performed computer simulations in which various numbers of 50-m subreaches were randomly selected and catches from each subreach were summed within the first three electrofishing passes to simulate removal sampling of site lengths ranging from 50 to 550 m. Population estimates were made using a removal estimator and density and biomass were calculated using various stratification schemes based on fish age and size. Estimates of density and biomass were then compared to the true values to assess the possible range in bias of estimates for a given reach length. Results from our simulations suggest a 200- to 250-m-long or a 400- to 450-m-long stream reach or site is needed to estimate brook trout density and biomass within 50% and 25%, respectively, of the true density and biomass.

The classical isotope pairing technique (IPT), the most common N-15 nitrate enrichment method to quantify denitrification, has recently been modified by different researchers to (1) discriminate between the N-2 produced by denitrification and anammox or to (2) provide a more accurate denitrification rate under considering production of both N2O and N-2. In case 1, the revised IPT focused on N-2 production being suitable for the environments of a low N2O-to-N-2 production ratio, while in case 2, anammox was neglected. This paper develops a modified method to refine previous versions of IPT. Cryogenic traps were installed to separately preconcentrate N-2 and N2O, thus allowing for subsequent measurement of the two gases generated in one sample vial. The precision is better than 2% for N-2 (m/z 28, m/z 29 and m/z 30), and 1.5% for N2O (m/z 44, m/z 45 and m/z 46). Based on the six m/z peaks of the two gases, the N-15 nitrate traceable processes including N-2 and N2O from denitrification and N-2 from anammox were estimated. Meanwhile, N2O produced by nitrification was estimated via the production rate of unlabeled (N2O)-N-44. To validate the applicability of our modified method, incubation experiments were conducted using sediment cores taken from the Danshuei Estuary in Taiwan. Rates of the aforementioned nitrogen removal processes were successfully determined. Moreover, N2O yield was as high as 66 %, which would significantly bias previous IPT approaches if N2O was not considered. Our modified method not only complements previous versions of IPT but also provides more comprehensive information to advance our understanding of nitrogen dynamics of the water-sediment interface.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  60,10.5194/bg-10-7847-2013     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ANAEROBIC AMMONIUM OXIDATION;MEASURING BENTHIC DENITRIFICATION;NITROUS-OXIDE PRODUCTION;NITRATE REDUCTION;DISSIMILATORY REDUCTION;SIMULATION ANALYSIS;CONTINENTAL-SHELF;COLNE ESTUARY;FRESH-WATER;ANAMMOX,,

Sharing information among data types based on the underlying ecological, and recognizing observation biases, can improve estimation of individual and global parameters. We present a general integrated population model (IPM), specifically designed for brown bears (Ursus arctos), using three common data types for bear (U. spp.) populations: repeated counts, capture-mark-recapture, and litter size. We considered factors affecting ecological and observation processes for these data. We assessed the practicality of this approach on a simulated population and compared estimates from our model to values used for simulation and results from count data only. We then present a practical application of this general approach adapted to the constraints of a case study using historical data available for brown bears on Kodiak Island, Alaska, USA. The IPM provided more accurate and precise estimates than models accounting for repeated count data only, with credible intervals including the true population 94% and 5% of the time, respectively. For the Kodiak population, we estimated annual average litter size (within one year after birth) to vary between 0.45 [95% credible interval: 0.43; 0.55] and 1.59 [1.55; 1.82]. We detected a positive relationship between salmon availability and adult survival, with survival probabilities greater for females than males. Survival probabilities increased from cubs to yearlings to dependent young 2years old and decreased with litter size. Linking multiple information sources based on ecological and observation mechanisms can provide more accurate and precise estimates, to better inform management.

However, it is often difficult to assess the efficacy of control methods due to limited resources for monitoring. Managers may view effort on monitoring as effort taken away from performing management actions. We developed a method to estimate invasive species abundance, evaluate management effectiveness, and evaluate population growth over time from a combination of removal activities (e.g., trapping, ground shooting) using only data collected during removal efforts (method of removal, date, location, number of animals removed, and effort). This dynamic approach allows for abundance estimation at discrete time points and the estimation of population growth between removal periods. To test this approach, we simulated over 1 million conditions, including varying the length of the study, the size of the area examined, the number of removal events, the capture rates, and the area impacted by removal efforts. Our estimates were unbiased (within 10% of truth) 81% of the time and were correlated with truth 91% of the time. This method performs well overall and, in particular, at monitoring trends in abundances over time. We applied this method to removal data from Mingo National Wildlife Refuge in Missouri from December 2015 to September 2019, where the management objective is elimination. Populations of feral swine on Mingo NWR have fluctuated over time but showed marked declines in the last 3-6 months of the time series corresponding to increased removal pressure. Our approach allows for the estimation of population growth across time (from both births and immigration) and therefore, provides a target removal rate (above that of the population growth) to ensure the population will decline. In Mingo NWR, the target monthly removal rate is 18% to cause a population decline. Our method provides advancement over traditional removal modeling approaches because it can be applied to evaluate management programs that use a broad range of removal techniques concurrently and whose management effort and spatial coverage vary across time.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  47,10.1002/eap.2623,dynamic model;invasive species management;multi-method framework;removal sampling;simulation analysis;Sus scrofa;DETECTION PROBABILITY PARAMETERS;MULTISCALE OCCUPANCY ESTIMATION;ESTIMATING SITE OCCUPANCY;SUS-SCROFA;WILD PIGS;REMOVAL;RECAPTURE;ABUNDANCE;CAPTURE;AVAILABILITY,,

(2019), we used simulations to quantitatively compare the bias of commonly used study designs in ecology and conservation. Based on these simulations, we proposed 'accuracy weights' as a potential way to account for study design validity in meta-analytic weighting methods. Pescott and Stewart (2022) raised concerns that these weights may not be generalisable and still lead to biased meta-estimates. Here we respond to their concerns and demonstrate why developing alternative weighting methods is key to the future of evidence synthesis. We acknowledge that our simple simulation unfairly penalised randomised controlled trial (RCT) relative to before-after control-impact (BACI) designs as we considered that the parallel trends assumption held for BACI designs. We point to an empirical follow-up study in which we more fairly quantify differences in biases between different study designs. However, we stand by our main findings that before-after (BA), control-impact (CI) and after designs are quantifiably more biased than BACI and RCT designs. We also emphasise that our 'accuracy weighting' method was preliminary and welcome future research to incorporate more dimensions of study quality. We further show that over a decade of advances in quality effect modelling, which Pescott and Stewart (2022) omit, highlights the importance of research such as ours in better understanding how to quantitatively integrate data on study quality directly into meta-analyses. We further argue that the traditional methods advocated for by Pescott and Stewart (2022; e.g. manual risk-of-bias assessments and inverse-variance weighting) are subjective, wasteful and potentially biased themselves. They also lack scalability for use in large syntheses that keep up-to-date with the rapidly growing scientific literature. Synthesis and applications. We suggest, contrary to Pescott and Stewart's narrative, that moving towards alternative weighting methods is key to future-proofing evidence synthesis through greater automation, flexibility and updating to respond to decision-makers' needs-particularly in crisis disciplines in conservation science where problematic biases and variability exist in study designs, contexts and metrics used. While we must be cautious to avoid misinforming decision-makers, this should not stop us investigating alternative weighting methods that integrate study quality data directly into meta-analyses. To reliably and pragmatically inform decision-makers with science, we need efficient, scalable, readily automated and feasible methods to appraise and weight studies to produce large-scale living syntheses of the future.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  58,10.1111/1365-2664.14154,automation;bias adjustment;critical appraisal;dynamic meta-analyses;evidence synthesis;living reviews;quality effects modelling;risk of bias;HEALTH-CARE;ECOSYSTEM;QUALITY;BIAS;METAANALYSIS;FUTURE;Thinking,,

However, bringing these tools together is not always straightforward. Matching data with model output, determining starting conditions, and addressing high dimensionality are some of the complexities that arise when attempting to incorporate ecological field data with mechanistic models directly using sophisticated statistical methods. To illustrate these complexities and pragmatic paths forward, we present an analysis using tree-ring basal area reconstructions in Denali National Park (DNPP) to constrain successional trajectories of two spruce species (Picea mariana and Picea glauca) simulated by a forest gap model, University of Virginia Forest Model Enhanced-UVAFME. Through this process, we provide preliminary ecological inference about the long-term competitive dynamics between slow-growing P. mariana and relatively faster-growing P. glauca.

Modelers frequently address sampling bias by manipulating training data: either subsampling presence data or creating a similar spatial bias in non-presence background data. We tested a new method, which we call 'background thickening', in the latter category. Background thickening entails concentrating background locations around presence locations in proportion to presence location density. We compared background thickening to two established sampling bias correction methods - target group background selection and presence thinning - using simulated data and data from a case study. In the case study, background thickening and presence thinning performed similarly well, both producing better model discrimination than target group background selection, and better model calibration than models without correction. In the simulation, background thickening performed better than presence thinning when the number of simulated presence locations was low, and vice versa. We discuss drawbacks to target group background selection, why background thickening and presence thinning are conservative but robust sampling bias correction methods, and why background thickening is better than presence thinning for small sample sizes. Particularly, background thickening is advantageous for treating sampling bias when data are scarce because it avoids discarding presence records.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  26     Cited Reference Count:  57,10.1111/ecog.04503     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),bias correction;Maxent;presence-background modeling;presence thinning;sampling bias;species distribution model;target group background selection;virtual species;POINT PROCESS MODELS;SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION;COLLECTION DATA;SAMPLING BIAS;NICHE;PERFORMANCE;MAXENT;IMPROVE;ABSENCE;REDUCE;Bias (Epidemiology),,

Recent research has shown that errors at adjacent sites often occur during DNA replication, and the resulting multinucleotide mutations (MNMs) are overwhelmingly likely to be non-synonymous. To evaluate whether the BST misinterprets sequence patterns produced by MNMs as false support for positive selection, we analysed two genomescale datasetsone from mammals and one from flies. We found that codons with multiple differences account for virtually all the support for lineage-specific positive selection in the BST. Simulations under conditions derived from these alignments but without positive selection show that realistic rates of MNMs cause a strong and systematic bias towards false inferences of selection. This bias is sufficient under empirically derived conditions to produce false positive inferences as often as the BST infers positive selection from the empirical data. Although some genes with BST-positive results may have evolved adaptively, the test cannot distinguish sequence patterns produced by authentic positive selection from those caused by neutral fixation of MNMs. Many published inferences of adaptive evolution using this technique may therefore be artefacts of model violation caused by unincorporated neutral mutational processes.

The raw percentage of individuals in the sample (naive prevalence) is generally used for this purpose, but it is likely to be subject to two main sources of bias. First, the detectability of individuals is ignored; second, classification errors may occur due to some inherent limits of the diagnostic methods. We developed a hidden Markov (also known as multievent) capture-recapture model to estimate prevalence in free-ranging populations accounting for imperfect detectability and uncertainty in individual's classification. We carried out a simulation study to compare naive and model-based estimates of prevalence and assess the performance of our model under different sampling scenarios. We then illustrate our method with a real-world case study of estimating the prevalence of wolf (Canis lupus) and dog (Canis lupus familiaris) hybrids in a wolf population in northern Italy. We showed that the prevalence of hybrids could be estimated while accounting for both detectability and classification uncertainty. Model-based prevalence consistently had better performance than naive prevalence in the presence of differential detectability and assignment probability and was unbiased for sampling scenarios with high detectability. We also showed that ignoring detectability and uncertainty in the wolf case study would lead to underestimating the prevalence of hybrids. Our results underline the importance of a model-based approach to obtain unbiased estimates of prevalence of different population segments. Our model can be adapted to any taxa, and it can be used to estimate absolute abundance and prevalence in a variety of cases involving imperfect detection and uncertainty in classification of individuals (e.g., sex ratio, proportion of breeders, and prevalence of infected individuals).",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  49,10.1002/ece3.4819     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),anthropogenic introgression;capture-recapture;hidden Markov models;hybridization;multievent models;prevalence;Viterbi algorithm;SURVIVAL;HYBRIDIZATION;MULTIEVENT;INFERENCE;COST;PACK;Animals;Animal Shells;Prevalence,,

The philosophy underlying risk assessment should be robust to these limitations. While there is a broad support for the concept of risk assessments, there is a tendency to rely on expert opinion and exclude formal data analysis, possibly because available information is often scarce. When data analyses are conducted, often much simplified models are advocated, even though this means excluding processes believed by experts to be important. In this manuscript, we ask: should statistical analyses be conducted and decisions modified based on a single datum? How many data points are needed before predictions are meaningful? Given limited data, how complex should models be? Location World-wide. Methods We use simulation approaches with known true' values to assess which inferences are possible, given different amounts of information. We use two metrics of performance: the magnitude of uncertainty (using posterior mean squared error) and bias (using PP plots). We assess six models of relevance to conservation ecologists. Results We show that the greatest reduction in uncertainty occurred at the smallest sample sizes for models examined, and much of parameter space could be excluded. Thus, analyses based on even a single datum potentially can be useful. Further, with only a few observations, the predicted distribution of outcomes matched the probabilities of actual occurrences, even for relatively complex state-space models with multiple sources of stochasticity. Main conclusions We highlight the utility of quantitative analyses even with severely limited data, given existing practices and arguments in the conservation literature.

The rarity of found carcasses is exacerbated when live members of a particular species are rare and when carcasses degrade quickly, are removed by scavengers, or are not detected by observers. With few observed carcass counts, common statistical methods like logistic, Poisson, or negative binomial regression are unreliable (statistically biased) and often fail to provide answers (i.e., fail to converge). Here, we propose a binomial N-mixture model that estimates fatality rates as well as the total number of carcasses when rates are expanded. Our model extends the ""evidence of absence"" model by relating carcass deposition rates to study covariates and by incorporating terms that naturally scale counts from facilities of different sizes. Our model, which we call Evidence of Absence Regression (EoAR), can estimate the total number of birds or bats killed at a single wind energy facility or a fleet of wind energy facilities based on covariate values. Furthermore, with accurate prior distributions the model's results are extremely robust to sparse data and unobserved combinations of covariate values.

Diversity profiles, a plotted series of Hill numbers, simultaneously capture the common diversity indices. However, diversity metrics require information on species abundance, often relying on raw count data without accounting for imperfect and varying detection. Hierarchical occupancy models account for variation in detectability, and Hill numbers have been expanded to allow estimation based on occupancy probability. But the ability of occupancy-based diversity profiles to reproduce patterns in abundance-based diversity has not been investigated. Here, we fit community occupancy models to simulated animal communities to explore how well occupancy-based diversity profiles reflect patterns in true abundance-based diversity. Because we expect occupancy-based diversity to be overestimated, we further tested a occupancy thresholding approach to reduce potential biases in the estimated diversity profiles. Finally, we use empirical bird community data to present how the framework can be extended to consider species similarity. The simulation study showed that occupancy-based diversity profiles produced among-community patterns in diversity similar to true abundance diversity profiles, although within-community diversity was generally overestimated. Applying an occupancy threshold reduced positive bias, but resulted in negative bias in richness estimates and slightly reduced the ability to reproduce true differences among the simulated communities; thus, we do not recommend application of this threshold. Application of our approach to a large bird dataset indicated differential species diversity patterns in communities of different habitat types. Accounting for phylogenetic and ecological similarities between species reduced variability in diversity among habitats. Our framework allows investigating the complexity of diversity from species detection data, while accounting for imperfect and varying detection probabilities, as well as species similarities. Visualizing results in the form of diversity profiles facilitates comparison of diversity between sites or across time. The approach offers opportunities for further development, for example by using local abundances estimated using the Royle-Nichols or N-mixture models and further exploration of thresholding methods. In spite of some challenges, occupancy-based diversity profiles are useful for studying and monitoring patterns in biodiversity.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  56,10.1111/ecog.05577,biodiversity;diversity index;diversity profile;occupancy;presence;species distribution modeling;specificity;threshold;PRESENCE-ABSENCE DATA;SPECIES RICHNESS;PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY;BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES;DETECTION PROBABILITY;HILL NUMBERS;CONSERVATION;ABUNDANCE;MODELS;SELECTION,,

Proxies of abundance are therefore common, but require calibration and validation. There are many ways to calibrate a proxy, and it is not obvious which will perform best. We used data from eight populations of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha on the Oregon coast where multiple proxies of abundance were obtained contemporaneously with independent mark-recapture estimates. We combined multiple proxy values associated with a single level of abundance into a composite index and then calibrated the composite index to mark-recapture estimates using several different techniques. We tested our calibration methods using leave-one-out cross-validation and simulation. Our cross-validation analysis did not definitively identify a single best calibration technique for all populations, but we could identify consistently inferior approaches. The simulations suggested that incorporating the uncertainty associated with mark-recapture estimates into the calibration technique reduced precision and introduced bias when mark-recapture estimate uncertainty increased with point estimate values. Cross-validation techniques can be used to test multiple methods of calibrating multiple proxies to an estimate of abundance.

Partner availabilities can play an important role in enabling species interactions, where uneven partner availabilities can bias estimates of biotic specialization when using phylogenetic diversity indices. It is therefore important to account for partner availability when characterizing biotic specialization using phylogenies. We developed an index, phylogenetic structure of specialization (PSS), that avoids bias from uneven partner availabilities by uncoupling the null models for interaction frequency and phylogenetic distance. We incorporate the deviation between observed and random interaction frequencies as weights into the calculation of partner phylogenetic alpha-diversity. To calculate the PSS index, we then compare observed partner phylogenetic alpha-diversity to a null distribution generated by randomizing phylogenetic distances among the same number of partners. PSS quantifies the phylogenetic structure (i.e., clustered, overdispersed, or random) of the partners of a focal species. We show with simulations that the PSS index is not correlated with network properties, which allows comparisons across multiple systems. We also implemented PSS on empirical networks of host-parasite, avian seed-dispersal, lichenized fungi-cyanobacteria, and hummingbird pollination interactions. Across these systems, a large proportion of taxa interact with phylogenetically random partners according to PSS, sometimes to a larger extent than detected with an existing method that does not account for partner availability. We also found that many taxa interact with phylogenetically clustered partners, while taxa with overdispersed partners were rare. We argue that species with phylogenetically overdispersed partners have often been misinterpreted as generalists when they should be considered specialists. Our results highlight the important role of randomness in shaping interaction networks, even in highly intimate symbioses, and provide a much-needed quantitative framework to assess the role that evolutionary history and symbiotic specialization play in shaping patterns of biodiversity.

These purely correlative models neglect spatial population dynamics and assume that species distributions are in equilibrium with their environment. This causes biased estimates of species niches and handicaps forecasts of range dynamics under environmental change. Here we aim to develop an approach that statistically estimates process-based models of range dynamics from data on species distributions and permits a more comprehensive quantification of forecast uncertainties.        Innovation We present an approach for the statistical estimation of process-based dynamic range models (DRMs) that integrate Hutchinson's niche concept with spatial population dynamics. In a hierarchical Bayesian framework the environmental response of demographic rates, local population dynamics and dispersal are estimated conditional upon each other while accounting for various sources of uncertainty. The method thus: (1) jointly infers species niches and spatiotemporal population dynamics from occurrence and abundance data, and (2) provides fully probabilistic forecasts of future range dynamics under environmental change. In a simulation study, we investigate the performance of DRMs for a variety of scenarios that differ in both ecological dynamics and the data used for model estimation.        Main conclusions Our results demonstrate the importance of considering dynamic aspects in the collection and analysis of biodiversity data. In combination with informative data, the presented framework has the potential to markedly improve the quantification of ecological niches, the process-based understanding of range dynamics and the forecasting of species responses to environmental change.

Results We provide evidence that historically, species with traits promoting urban colonization have undergone faster diversification than urban-avoidant species, indicating that urbanization favours clades with a historical tendency towards rapid speciation or reduced extinction. In addition, we find that past transitions towards states that currently impede urban colonization by passerines have been more frequent than in the opposite direction. Furthermore, we find a portion of urban-avoidant passerines to be recent and to undergo fast diversification. All highly supported models give this result consistently. Main conclusions Urbanization is mainly associated with the loss of lineages that are inherently more vulnerable to extinction over deep time, whereas cities tend to be colonized by less vulnerable lineages, for which urbanization might be neutral or positive in terms of longer-term diversification. Urban avoidance is associated with high rates of recent diversification for some clades occurring in regions with relatively intact natural ecosystems and low current levels of urbanization.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  63,10.1111/geb.13558,anthropic habitats;land-use change;macroevolution;passerines;trait-dependent diversification;urban biodiversity;TRAIT-DEPENDENT SPECIATION;CLIMATIC-NICHE EVOLUTION;EXTINCTION RISK;URBANIZATION;PATTERNS;SHIFTS,,

Understanding how the transcriptome evolves is therefore a key priority in identifying mechanisms of adaptive change. However, in contrast to powerful models of sequence evolution, we lack a consensus model of gene expression evolution. Furthermore, recent work has shown that many of the comparative approaches used to study gene expression are subject to biases that can lead to false signatures of selection. Here we first outline the main approaches for describing expression evolution and their inherent biases. Next, we bridge the gap between the fields of phylogenetic comparative methods and transcriptomics to reinforce the main pitfalls of inferring selection on expression patterns and use simulation studies to show that shifts in tissue composition can heavily bias inferences of selection. We close by highlighting the multi-dimensional nature of transcriptional variation and identifying major unanswered questions in disentangling how selection acts on the transcriptome.

Marine fossils are expected to record the range shift responses of taxa and ecosystems to past climate change. However, unequal sampling (natural and human) in time and space biases the fossil record, restricting previous studies of ancient migrations to individual taxa and events. We expect that temporal changes in the latitudinal distribution of surviving taxa will reveal range shifts to trace global climate change.        Location: Global.        Time period: Post-Cambrian Phanerozoic aeon.        Major taxa studied: Well-fossilized marine benthic invertebrates comprising stony corals, bivalves, gastropods, brachiopods, trilobites and calcifying sponges.        Methods: We track deviations in the latitudinal distribution of range centres of age boundary crossing taxa from the expected distribution, and compare responses across latitudes. We build deviation time series, spanning hundreds of million years, from fossil occurrences and test correlations with seawater temperature estimates derived from stable oxygen isotopes of fossils.        Results: Seawater temperature and latitudinal deviations from sampling are positively correlated over the post-Cambrian Phanerozoic. Simulations suggest that sampling patterns are highly unlikely to drive this putative signal of range shifts. Systematically accounting for known sampling issues strengthens this correlation, so that climate is capable of explaining nearly a third of the variance in ancient latitudinal range shifts. The relationship is stronger in low latitude taxa than higher latitude taxa, and in warm ages than cool ages.        Main conclusions: Latitudinal range shifts occurred in concert with climate change throughout the post-Cambrian Phanerozoic. Low latitude taxa show the clearest climate-migration signal through time, corroborating predictions of their shift in a warming future.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  56,10.1111/geb.12732     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),delta O-18;fossil;latitude;out of the tropics;Paleobiology Database;Phanerozoic;sampling bias;time series;RANGE SHIFTS;REEF CORALS;DIVERSITY;EXTINCTION;DYNAMICS;TEMPERATURES;ORIGINATION;SENSITIVITY;COMPONENTS;GRADIENT;Military Personnel,,

Bayesian latent class analysis (BLCA) modeling offers a potential solution, providing estimates of prevalence levels and diagnostic test accuracy under the realistic assumption that no diagnostic test is perfect. In typical applications of this approach, the specificity of one test is fixed at or close to 100%, allowing the model to simultaneously estimate the sensitivity and specificity of all other tests, in addition to infection prevalence. In wildlife systems, a test with near-perfect specificity is not always available, so we simulated data to investigate how decreasing this fixed specificity value affects the accuracy of model estimates. We used simulations to explore how the trade-off between diagnostic test specificity and sensitivity impacts prevalence estimates and found that directional biases depend on pathogen prevalence. Both the precision and accuracy of results depend on the sample size, the diagnostic tests used, and the true infection prevalence, so these factors should be considered when applying BLCA to estimate disease prevalence and diagnostic test accuracy in wildlife systems. A wildlife disease case study, focusing on leptospirosis in California sea lions, demonstrated the potential for Bayesian latent class methods to provide reliable estimates under real-world conditions. We delineate conditions under which BLCA improves upon the results from a single diagnostic across a range of prevalence levels and sample sizes, demonstrating when this method is preferable for disease ecologists working in a wide variety of pathogen systems.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  41,10.1002/ece3.6448,Bayesian latent class;California sea lion;diagnostic test;disease;infection;prevalence;sensitivity;specificity;IDENTIFYING RESERVOIRS;LEPTOSPIRA-INTERROGANS;DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY;CLASS MODELS;GOLD;VALIDATION;INFECTION;ELISA;PCR;Bias (Epidemiology),,

The projections of air temperature were consistent. All analysed climate models simulated an increase of air temperature with time. Analyses of changes at a monthly scale indicated that the largest increases were estimated for winter months (more than 11 degrees C for the far future using the RCP 8.5 scenario). The analyses of monthly and annual sums of precipitation also indicated increasing tendencies for changes with time, with the differences between mean monthly sums of precipitation for the near future and the reference period similar for each months.

Many statistical analyses of populations ignore potential autocorrelations and assume that survey methods (distance and time between samples) eliminate these correlations, allowing samples to be treated independently. If these assumptions are incorrect, results and therefore inference may be biased and uncertainty underestimated. We developed a novel statistical method to account for spatiotemporal correlations within dendritic stream networks, while accounting for imperfect detection in the surveys. Through simulations, we found this model decreased predictive error relative to standard statistical methods when data were spatially correlated based on stream distance and performed similarly when data were not correlated. We found that increasing the number of years surveyed substantially improved the model accuracy when estimating spatial and temporal correlation coefficients, especially from 10 to 15yr. Increasing the number of survey sites within the network improved the performance of the nonspatial model but only marginally improved the density estimates in the spatiotemporal model. We applied this model to brook trout data from the West Susquehanna Watershed in Pennsylvania collected over 34 yr from 1981 to 2014. We found the model including temporal and spatiotemporal autocorrelation best described young of the year (YOY) and adult density patterns. YOY densities were positively related to forest cover and negatively related to spring temperatures with low temporal autocorrelation and moderately high spatiotemporal correlation. Adult densities were less strongly affected by climatic conditions and less temporally variable than YOY but with similar spatiotemporal correlation and higher temporal autocorrelation.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  54,10.1002/eap.1767     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),brook trout;dendritic network;detection probability;Gaussian random fields;spatially explicit;spatiotemporal;SPATIAL STATISTICAL-MODELS;BROOK TROUT POPULATIONS;MOVING-AVERAGE APPROACH;MULTIMODEL INFERENCE;UNITED-STATES;VITAL-RATES;DYNAMICS;FLOOD;ABUNDANCE;SURVIVAL;Animals;Animal Shells,,

MethodsWe generated empirical species richness patterns using two data structures: (1) birds gridded from range maps and (2) tree communities from the US Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis. We analysed richness using linear regression, regression trees, generalized additive models, geographically weighted regression and simultaneous autoregression, with random intrinsic variables' as predictors generated by assigning random numbers to species and calculating averages in assemblages. We then generated simulations in which species with cohesive or patchy distributions are placed with respect to the North American temperature gradient with or without a broad-scale richness gradient. Random intrinsic variables are again used as predictors of richness. Finally, we analysed one simulated scenario with random intrinsic variables as both response and predictor variables.        ResultsThe models of bird and tree richness often explained moderate to large proportions of the variance. Regression trees, geographically weighted regression and simultaneous autoregression were very sensitive to the problem; generalized additive models were moderately affected, as was multiple regression to a lesser extent. In the virtual data, the variance explained increased with increasing species co-occurrences, but neither range cohesion, a richness gradient nor spatial autocorrelation in predictors had major impacts on the variance explained. The problem persisted when the response variable was also a random intrinsic variable.

However, species richness is difficult to measure in the field because some species will almost always be overlooked due to their cryptic nature or the observer's failure to perceive their cues. Common measures of species richness that assume consistent observability across species are inviting because they may require only single counts of species at survey sites. Single-visit estimation methods ignore spatial and temporal variation in species detection probabilities related to survey or site conditions that may confound estimates of species richness. We used simulated and empirical data to evaluate the bias and precision of raw species counts, the limiting forms of jackknife and Chao estimators, and multispecies occupancy models when estimating species richness to evaluate whether the choice of estimator can affect inferences about the relationships between environmental conditions and community size under variable detection processes. Four simulated scenarios with realistic and variable detection processes were considered. Results of simulations indicated that (1) raw species counts were always biased low, (2) single-visit jackknife and Chao estimators were significantly biased regardless of detection process, (3) multispecies occupancy models were more precise and generally less biased than the jackknife and Chao estimators, and (4) spatial heterogeneity resulting from the effects of a site covariate on species detection probabilities had significant impacts on the inferred relationships between species richness and a spatially explicit environmental condition. For a real data set of bird observations in northwestern Alaska, USA, the four estimation methods produced different estimates of local species richness, which severely affected inferences about the effects of shrubs on local avian richness. Overall, our results indicate that neglecting the effects of site covariates on species detection probabilities may lead to significant bias in estimation of species richness, as well as the inferred relationships between community size and environmental covariates.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  48,10.1890/14-1248.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Alaska, USA;biodiversity;Chao estimator;community size;jackknife estimator;landbirds;multispecies occupancy model;species richness;POPULATION-SIZE;COMMUNITIES;MODELS;OCCUPANCY;BIRDS;RATES;DETECTABILITY;ACCUMULATION;ESTIMATORS;TURNOVER;Bias (Epidemiology);Probability",,

These changes potentially impact the functions and services of marine ecosystems. A key question is whether marine ecosystems are already or will soon be exposed to environmental conditions not experienced during the last millennium. Using a forced simulation with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) over the period 850 to 2100, we find that anthropogenic deoxygenation and warming in the thermocline exceeded natural variability in, respectively, 60% and 90% of total ocean area. Control simulations are typically used to estimate the pre-industrial variability level. However, the natural variability of oxygen (O-2) and temperature (T) inferred from the last millennium period is systematically larger than the internal variability simulated in the corresponding control simulation. This renders natural variability from control simulations to be biased towards low estimates. Here, natural variability is assessed from the last millennium period (850-1800 CE), thus considering the response to forcing from explosive volcanic eruptions, solar irradiance and greenhouse gases in addition to internal, chaotic variability. Results suggest that in the tropical thermocline, where biological and solubility-driven O-2 changes counteract each other, anthropogenic changes in apparent oxygen utilisation (AOU) and in O-2 solubility (O-2; sol) are detectable earlier than O-2 changes. Both natural variability and change in AOU are predominantly driven by variations in circulation with a smaller role for productivity. By the end of the 21st century, ventilation becomes more vigorous in the tropical thermocline, whereas ideal age in deep waters increases by more than 200 years relative to the pre-industrial period. Different methodological choices are compared and the time for an anthropogenic signal to emerge (ToE) is earlier in many thermocline regions when using variability from a shorter period, from the control simulation or estimates from the industrial period instead of the variability from the last millennium. Our results highlight that published methods may lead to deviations in ToE estimates, calling for a careful quantification of variability. They also highlight that realised anthropogenic change exceeds natural variations in many regions.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  104,10.5194/bg-16-1755-2019     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),OXYGEN-MINIMUM ZONES;CARBON-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS;CLIMATE-CHANGE;VOLCANIC-ERUPTIONS;21ST-CENTURY PROJECTIONS;NATURAL VARIABILITY;TROPICAL PACIFIC;LAST MILLENNIUM;ATMOSPHERIC CO2;SYSTEM MODEL,,

Recent advances in estimating abundance of multiple species, such as Bayesian multispecies N-mixture models, account for multiple sources of variation, including detection error. However, false-positive errors (misidentification or double counts), which are prevalent in multispecies data sets, remain largely unaddressed. The dependent-double observer (DDO) method is an emerging method that both accounts for detection error and is suggested to reduce the occurrence of false positives because it relies on two observers working collaboratively to identify individuals. To date, the DDO method has not been combined with advantages of multispecies N-mixture models. Here, we derive an extension of a multispecies N-mixture model using the DDO survey method to create a multispecies dependent double-observer abundance model (MDAM). The MDAM uses a hierarchical framework to account for biological and observational processes in a statistically consistent framework while using the accurate observation data from the DDO survey method. We demonstrate that the MDAM accurately estimates abundance of multiple species with simulated and real multispecies data sets. Simulations showed that the model provides both precise and accurate abundance estimates, with average credible interval coverage across 100 repeated simulations of 94.5% for abundance estimates and 92.5% for detection estimates. In addition, 92.2% of abundance estimates had a mean absolute percent error between 0% and 20%, with a mean of 7.7%. We present the MDAM as an important step forward in expanding the applicability of the DDO method to a multispecies setting. Previous implementation of the DDO method suggests the MDAM can be applied to a broad array of biological communities. We suggest that researchers interested in assessing biological communities consider the MDAM as a tool for deriving accurate, multispecies abundance estimates.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  53,10.1002/ece3.2946     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),abundance model;Bayesian N-mixture model;dependent double-observer;false positive;multiple species;ESTIMATING ANIMAL ABUNDANCE;POINT-COUNT SURVEYS;ESTIMATING DETECTION PROBABILITY;BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY;SPECIES INTERACTIONS;REPLICATED COUNTS;BIRD COMMUNITIES;MOUNTAIN PLOVER;MIXTURE-MODELS;BURROWING OWL,,

Although most biodiversity monitoring initiatives are geared towards focal species of conservation concern, researchers are increasingly studying entire communities, specifically the spatiotemporal drivers of community size and structure and interactions among species. This has resulted in the emergence of multi-species occupancy models (MSOMs) as a promising and efficient approach for the study of community ecology. Given the potential of MSOMs for conservation and management action, it is critical to know whether study design and model assumptions are consistent with inference objectives. This is especially true for studies that are designed for a focal species but can give insights about a community. Here, we review the recent literature on MSOMs, identify areas of improvement in the multi-species study workflow, and provide a reference model for best practices for focal species and community monitoring study design. We reviewed 92 studies published between 2009 and early 2018, spanning 27 countries and a variety of taxa. There is a consistent under-reporting of details that are central to determining the adequacy of designs for generating data that can be used to make inferences about community-level patterns of occupancy, including the spatial and temporal extent, types of detectors used, covariates considered, and choice of field methods and statistical tools. This reporting bias could consequently result in skewed estimates, affecting conservation actions and management plans. On the other hand, comprehensive reporting is likely to help researchers working on MSOMs assess the robustness of inferences, in addition to making strides in terms of reproducibility and reusability of data. We use our literature review to inform a roadmap with best practices for MSOM studies, from simulations to design considerations and reporting, for the collection of new data as well as those involving existing datasets.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  43     Total Times Cited:  43     Cited Reference Count:  58,10.1111/ecog.04957,biotic interactions;community models;hierarchical models;multi-species models;occupancy;reporting bias;SPECIES RICHNESS;DATA-MANAGEMENT;CONSERVATION;COOCCURRENCE;SOFTWARE;SELECTION;PATTERNS;PACKAGE;DESIGN;Occupations,,

For waterfowl populations, annual estimates of these probabilities come from mark-recovery analysis of data from coordinated banding operations. The Brownie model is the most commonly used parameterization for analyzing mark-recovery data from harvested species. However, if banded waterfowl are not released during a year of a multiyear banding operation, then estimating annual survival and recovery probabilities from a dead recovery model is a challenge. Due to coronavirus disease 2019, many wildlife monitoring efforts, including annual waterfowl banding programs, were canceled or reduced during 2020 and 2021, highlighting the need for wildlife managers to better understand the consequences of missing data on analyses and regulatory decisions. We summarized methods of model parameterization and use of alternative methods to explore the behavior of demographic parameter estimates when a year of release data was missing. Comparing constrained fixed-effect models (we set parameters during the missing year of data equal to parameters for years with release data) with random-effect models, we found that 1) bias of estimates during a year of missing release data was smaller when using a random-effect model, 2) the direction of the bias was unpredictable, but the expected range in bias could be generally known commensurate to the underlying variability in survival and recovery probabilities, and 3) potential bias was greatest if the missing year of releases occurred during the final year of a time series. We conclude that in some circumstances, various modeling approaches can provide reasonable estimates during a year of missing release data, particularly when underlying demographic parameters, or the parameter constrained in a model, vary little over time (e.g., adult survival in long-lived species), which would result in relatively little bias in the other estimated parameter (e.g., annual recovery probability). We also suggest that using alternative analytical techniques, such as random-effect models, may improve estimates for the demographic parameters of interest when release data are missing. Random-effect models also allowed us to estimate parameters, such as juvenile recovery probabilities, during the year of missing release data, which are not identifiable using standard modeling techniques. Where accurate and precise parameter estimation is important for making harvest management decisions and regardless of the model type or the data used, there is no analytical replacement for missing release data. We suggest that practitioners determine the potential consequences for missing data through simulation by using empirical data and simulated data with known demographic probabilities to determine the best actions to take for analyzing their capture-recovery data when release data are missing.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  46,10.3996/JFWM-21-017     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Brownie model;Canada goose;capture-mark-recovery analyses;missing data;survival;CANADA GEESE;SURVIVAL RATES;HARVEST;AGE;HYPOTHESES;RECAPTURE;MODELS;SIZE,,

Detection errors bias estimates of detection and abundance or occupancy in positive and negative directions, which can produce misleading results. There have been considerable design- and model-based methods to address false-negative errors, or missed detections. However, false-positive errors, or detections of individuals that are absent but counted as present because of misidentifications or double counts, are often assumed to not occur in ecological studies. The dependent double-observer survey method is a design-based approach speculated to reduce false positives because observations have the ability to be confirmed by two observers. However, whether this method reduces false positives compared to single-observer methods has not been empirically tested. We used prairie songbirds as a model system to test if a dependent double-observer method reduced false positives compared to a single-observer method. We used vocalizations of ten species to create auditory simulations and used naive and expert observers to survey these simulations using single-observer and dependent double-observer methods. False-positive rates were significantly lower using the dependent double-observer survey method in both observer groups. Expert observers reported a 3.2% false-positive rate in dependent double-observer surveys and a 9.5% false-positive rate in single-observer surveys, while naive observers reported a 39.1% false-positive rate in dependent double-observer surveys and a 49.1% false-positive rate in single-observer surveys. Misidentification errors arose in all survey scenarios and almost all species combinations. However, expert observers using the dependent double-observer method performed significantly better than other survey scenarios.

Our first aim was to develop a taxon co-occurrence analysis method that is also capable of taking into account the effect of species ranges and can handle faunistic records from museum databases or biodiversity inventories. Our second aim was to test the independence of taxon co-occurrences of rock-dwelling gastropods at different taxonomic levels, with a special focus on the Clausiliidae subfamily Alopiinae, and in particular the genus Montenegrina.        Location: Balkan Peninsula in south-eastern Europe (46N-36N, 13.5E-28E).        Methods: We introduced a taxon-specific metric that characterizes the occurrence probability at a given location. This probability was calculated as a distance-weighted mean of the taxon's presence and absence records at all sites. We applied corrections to account for the biases introduced by varying sampling intensity in our dataset. Then we used probabilistic null-models to simulate taxon distributions under the null hypothesis of no taxon interactions and calculated pairwise and cumulated co-occurrences. Independence of taxon occurrences was tested by comparing observed co-occurrences to simulated values.        Results: We observed significantly fewer co-occurrences among species and intra-generic lineages of Montenegrina than expected under the assumption of no taxon interaction.        Main conclusions: Fewer than expected co-occurrences among species and intrageneric clades indicate that species divergence preceded niche partitioning. This suggests a primary role of non-adaptive processes in the speciation of rock-dwelling gastropods.

Design A tested an escapement flap on the interior of the modified fyke net and design B tested an escapement throat on the exterior of the modified fyke net. We completed 4-h and 24-h trials for turtle escapement to determine the effectiveness of each design for reducing turtle bycatch.

Species-specific escapement rates were observed for fish in both designs. Significant differences in the size structure of some species were observed. Escapement rates from design A were likely underestimated for most species captured due to movement of fish and turtles from the holding pen back into the fyke net.

Methods We performed population genetic analyses using mitochondrial control region sequences of 550 individuals from 25 locations sampled along the Eastern Adriatic coast. Investigations of population structure included differentiation tests, cluster analyses and distance-based redundancy analysis. We then ran Lagrangian simulations of passive larval drift to examine correlations among population structure, geographic distance and the Adriatic gyre system. To test for signatures of a post-glacial range expansion, we modelled the demographic history of the populations and examined the geographic distribution of genetic diversity. Results Genetic population structure corresponded to the Adriatic gyres without additional effect of geographic distance. Inference of northward-biased gene flow between the northern and the Istrian gyre was consistent with simulated trajectories of passive drift, whereas the phylogeographic break coinciding with the boundary between the Central and the Northern Adriatic gyre was stronger than predicted by drift simulations. Genetic connectivity of populations within gyres was high. Genetic signatures of population expansion were consistent with a rapid post-glacial recolonization of the northern Adriatic.

Data quality may affect estimations of species richness, but most broad-scale studies do not take sampling biases into account. We analysed reptile richness on islands that have received different sampling efforts, and assessed how inventory completeness affects the results of ecogeographical analyses. We also used simulations to evaluate under what circumstances insufficient sampling can bias the outcome of biodiversity analyses.        LocationMediterranean islands.        MethodsWe gathered data on reptile richness from 974 islands, assuming better sampling in islands with specific inventories. We used Moran's eigenvector mapping to analyse the factors that determine whether an island has been surveyed, and to identify the relationships between reptile richness, geographical parameters and anthropic parameters. We simulated islands, mimicking patterns of true data, and sampled them with varying effort. Simulated richness was analysed using the same approach used for real-world data.        ResultsThe probability that islands were sampled for reptiles was higher in large, human-populated islands. The relationship between human impact and reptile richness was negative in well-surveyed islands, but positive in islands that had not been systematically surveyed, because densely populated and accessible islands receive better sampling. In simulations, analyses successfully retrieved the relationships between species richness and human presence only if the average species detection probability was 75%. Poorer sampling resulted in biased regression results.        Main conclusionsHuman activities may strongly affect biodiversity, but human presence and accessibility improve sampling effort and thus the quality of biodiversity information. Therefore, regressing known species richness on parameters representing human presence may result in apparent positive relationships.

Using simulated data we evaluated the performance of different statistical methods for estimating density from camera trap data including the closed-population capture-recapture models M-o and M-h with a buffer of 1/2 and the full mean maximum distance moved (MMDM) and spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models under different study designs and scenarios. We found that for the studies reviewed density estimates were negatively correlated with camera polygon size and MMDM estimates were positively correlated. The simulations showed that for camera polygons that were smaller than approximately one home range density estimates for all methods had a positive bias. For large polygons the Mh MMDM and SECR model produced the most accurate results and elongated polygons can improve estimates with the SECR model. When encounter rates and home range sizes varied by sex, estimates had a negative bias for models that did not include sex as a covariate. Based on the simulations we concluded that the majority of jaguar camera trap studies did not meet the requirements necessary to produce unbiased density estimates and likely overestimated true densities. We make clear recommendations for future study designs with respect to camera layout, number of cameras, study length, and camera placement. Our findings directly apply to camera trap studies of other large carnivores. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In flowering plants, inbreeding depression commonly acts most intensely during seed development. This predispersal component is typically estimated by comparing seed production following exclusive self- and cross-pollination, but such estimates are unbiased only if seed production is limited by ovule availability, rather than by pollen receipt or seed-development resources. To overcome this problem, we propose experimental and statistical methods based on a model of ovule fertilization and seed development that accounts for differential fertilization by self- and cross-pollen, limited ovule viability or receptivity, differential survival of self- and cross-zygotes and limited resource availability. Simulations illustrate that the proposed methods eliminate bias in estimated predispersal inbreeding depression caused by pollen limitation and can improve estimates under resource limitation. Application of these methods to two orchid species further demonstrates their utility in identifying and estimating diverse influences on reproductive performance under typical conditions. Although our theoretical results raise questions about the reported intensity of predispersal inbreeding depression, our proposed methods guard against bias while also providing insight into plant reproduction.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  29,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01515.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Inbreeding depression;ovule limitation;pollen limitation;pollen tube;resource limitation;seed production;SELF-FERTILIZATION;EVOLUTION;PLANTS;LIMITS,,

Many male-biased clades display more prominent sexual dimorphism in larger taxa (Rensch's rule), with most examples documenting this pattern for body size dimorphism. Although sexual dimorphism in traits other than body size is equally functionally relevant, characterizing allometric patterns of sexual dimorphism in such traits is hampered by lack of an analytical framework that can accommodate multivariate phenotypes. In this article, we derive a multivariate equivalency for investigating trends in sexual dimorphism-relative to overall body size-across taxa and provide a generalized test to determine whether such allometric patterns correspond with Rensch's rule. For univariate linear traits such as body size, our approach yields equivalent results to those from standard procedures, but our test is also capable of detecting trends in multivariate datasets such as shape. Computer simulations reveal that the method displays appropriate statistical properties, and an empirical example in Mediterranean lizards provides the first demonstration of Rensch's rule in a multivariate phenotype (head shape).

The objective of this study is to evaluate future changes in BMPs on total phosphorus (TP) loads to the river system, depending on climate change. Current weather data were collected from 2000 to 2010 and future weather data from 2040 to 2050 were obtained from regional climate model simulations based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 scenarios. This study describes various BMP implementation plans at affordable cost that are adapted to different weather conditions, current (for 2000-2010) and future climate scenarios (for 2040-2050). The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), i.e., one of the deterministic models for watershed management, was used to estimate total phosphorus (TP) removal efficiency of various types of BMP at two crop fields (rice paddy and soybean fields) in the Yeongsan River (YR) watershed of Korea. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), i.e., one of the artificial intelligence (AI) models for decision support framework, was applied to obtain allow for trade-off analysis between two conflict objectives, the maximum TP load reduction against implementation costs. The SWAT simulation results showed that the model performance based on the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and percent bias was acceptable for simulating three parameters; daily flow discharge, monthly sediment loads, and TP loads in the river. As a result, monthly sediment loads and TP loads increase remarkably under all future climate change scenarios except for July, when a comparable amount of precipitation is recorded during the present and future conditions. New implementation of BMPs, therefore, will be required for future climate change scenarios to achieve 50% TP load reduction in the given watershed condition. Interestingly, parallel terraces which showed good efficiency in reducing TP loads at both fields under the current weather condition cannot be effective any more under the worst-case weather scenario in the future climate. In such a case, detention ponds can be proposed as BMP alternative to parallel terraces. Overall, this study not only demonstrates that watershed management plans using BMPs should be adjusted according to climate change scenarios, but also that the hybrid use of SWAT model and AI can help in refining existing and future BMPs at affordable cost.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  49,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.05.006     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Climate change;Best management practices;SWAT;Diffuse pollution;Multi-objective optimization;SOURCE POLLUTION REDUCTION;SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS;GENETIC ALGORITHM;YEONGSAN RIVER;CHANGE IMPACT;SWAT MODEL;QUALITY;KOREA;RUNOFF;SIMULATIONS;Decision Support Techniques,,

Such convergent evolution can arise via shared constraints and/or shared selective pressures but the extent to which SSS is adaptive is unresolved. In particular, because mating in plants occurs primarily among near neighbors, any fitness benefits of SSS should usually be offset by the separation of mating partners during reproduction. It has been argued that the problem of mating in plants with SSS should be alleviated in plants with more reliable modes of pollination, such as wind pollination. Accordingly, we evaluated the association between SSS and pollination mode using phylogenetically controlled comparative analyses. Moreover, because outcrossing plants produce many more pollen grains than ovules, females should compete less intensely for mating partners than males. We therefore predicted that any fitness costs arising from segregation should be greater for males than females. We evaluated this prediction using spatially explicit stochastic simulations. The comparative analyses indicated that there is indeed a positive association between wind pollination and SSS, but also that SSS might be associated with clonal growth. Because methods used for detecting SSS can be biased by clonality, this raises the possibility that some cases of SSS are 'false positives'. The simulation results supported the prediction that male fitness is more strongly affected by segregation than female fitness. Contrary to arguments based on anecdotal evidence, increasing the effectiveness of pollen dispersal had little effect on the fitness of segregated males. Instead, our results indicated that the evolutionary maintenance of SSS requires substantial performance advantages to segregated males. However, there is little empirical evidence that such performance advantages exist. Future efforts to understand the evolution of SSS should focus on the detection of performance differences between segregated and unsegregated plants, particularly males.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  62,10.1007/s10682-014-9733-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Comparative analysis;Dioecy;Sexual dimorphism;Stochastic simulation;Wind pollination;INTER-SEXUAL COMPETITION;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;RATIO VARIATION;CORRELATED EVOLUTION;GENE FLOW;DIMORPHISM;POPULATIONS;ALLOCATION;PATTERNS;DENSITY,,

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the performance of the SWAT model's built-in empirical soil temperature module and a physically-based soil temperature module using four years of daily soil temperature measurements at three depths (i.e., 5, 10, and 50 cm) across 10 monitoring stations in and around the Choptank River Watershed, Maryland, USA. Model performance is assessed according to three coefficients of accuracy, i.e., Bias, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS), and coefficient of determination (R-2). Model performance of SWAT and the modified version of SWAT (i.e., MSWAT; equipped with the physically-based soil temperature module) is also compared in winter and nonwinter seasons. Results show that R-2 and NS for different soil depths across 10 stations are all greater than 0.95 and 0.90, respectively, for both SWAT and MSWAT. This indicates that both SWAT and MSWAT reproduce well variations of measured soil temperatures at all soil depths for all stations. The results also show that SWAT and MSWAT tend to underestimate soil temperatures in both winter and non-winter seasons at all soil depths across 10 stations, and MSWAT improves soil temperature simulation by reducing absolute values of Bias, especially at surface soil layers in winter. We found out that a better representation of surface residue is needed in the physically-based soil temperature module for applications in agricultural watersheds of temperature regions.

Objectives Our objectives were to: (1) compare multiple modelling approaches, (2) evaluate the utility of landscape composition and configuration as predictors, (3) assess the influence of the ratio of forest loss and persistence points in the training sample, (4) identify the multiple-scale drivers of recent forest loss and (5) predict future forest loss risk across Borneo.        Methods We compared random forest machine learning and logistic regression in a multi-scale approach to model forest loss risk between 2000 and 2010 as a function of topographical variables and landscape structure, and applied the highest performing model to predict the spatial pattern of forest loss risk between 2010 and 2020. We utilized a naive model as a null comparison and used the total operating characteristic AUC to assess model performance.        Results Our analysis produced five main results. We found that: (1) random forest consistently outperformed logistic regression and the naive model; (2) including landscape structure variables substantially improved predictions; (3) a ratio of occurrence to non-occurrence points in the training dataset that does not match the actual ratio in the landscape biases the predictions of both random forest and logistic regression; (4) forest loss risk differed between the three nations that comprise Borneo, with patterns in Kalimantan highly related to distance from the edge of the previous frontier of forest loss, while Malaysian Borneo showed a more diffuse pattern related to the structure of the landscape; (5) we predicted continuing very high rates of forest loss in the 2010-2020 period, and produced maps of the expected risk of forest loss across the full extent of Borneo.

In the majority of cases, multinomial N-mixture models based on multiple observer protocols, that are hierarchical extensions of simple CMR, are applied in estimating abundance of animals with large body size, conspicuous behavior or high detection probabilities. We applied and evaluated the reliability of a multinomial N-mixture modelling approach with multiple observer data to a small and cryptic terrestrial salamander, found in different habitats where populations possess different level of detectability. Estimates obtained with multinomial N-mixture models were compared to estimates obtained with classical methods, such as removal sampling, and their reliability has also been evaluated by simulations scenarios. Our results show that multinomial N-mixture models, applied within a multiple observer framework, give reliable and robust estimates of population abundance even when detection and density are relatively low.

Here we propose using a simple but potentially robust method, the direct estimation of population growth rate (PGR) from capture-recapture data. We considered an Endangered population of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae breeding and calving annually in the southern lagoon of New Caledonia. Studied since 1996, this population is known to exhibit a strong signal of transience, i.e. the presence of individuals that pass through the sampling area once, inducing detection heterogeneity. Another difficulty is that a more recently discovered second breeding and calving habitat (offshore seamounts to the south) has been surveyed with less intensity. Current direct PGR estimation models cannot deal with spatial sampling heterogeneity. In order to assess the reliability of the proposed method-in general and for our population in particular-we evaluated its robustness using simulations: first, when there are transient individuals; then, when the study area is split into 2 unequally sampled parts. We found no bias in PGR in the presence of transients. The bias with 2 unequally sampled parts depends on the amount and direction of exchanges, but appears negligible in our case study. The constant yearly PGR of the New Caledonian humpback whale population at the level of the 2 habitats was estimated at 1.15 (95% CI 1.11-1.20), suggesting outside recruitment.

The interpretation of observations is simply another model, but this time not coded in a computer language but rather formed by the individual observer. We submit that it would be more productive to initiate a process where the norm is that models and observations are joined to strengthen both. In the end, neither method is the goal, but both are useful tools for disclosing the truth.

Spatially explicit reconstructions of viral spread represent valuable sources of lineage movement data that can be exploited to investigate the impact of underlying environmental layers on the dispersal of pathogens. Here, we performed phylogeographic inference and applied different post hoc approaches to analyse a new and comprehensive data set of viral genomes to elucidate the dispersal history and dynamics of rabies virus (RABV) in Iran, which have remained largely unknown. We first analysed the association between environmental factors and variations in dispersal velocity among lineages. Second, we present, test and apply a new approach to study the link between environmental conditions and the dispersal direction of lineages. The statistical performance (power of detection, false-positive rate) of this new method was assessed using simulations. We performed phylogeographic analyses of RABV genomes, allowing us to describe the large diversity of RABV in Iran and to confirm the cocirculation of several clades in the country. Overall, we estimate a relatively high lineage dispersal velocity, similar to previous estimates for dog rabies virus spread in northern Africa. Finally, we highlight a tendency for RABV lineages to spread in accessible areas associated with high human population density. Our analytical workflow illustrates how phylogeographic approaches can be used to investigate the impact of environmental factors on several aspects of viral dispersal dynamics.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  73,10.1111/mec.15222     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),dogs;Iran;molecular epidemiology;phylogeography;rabies;EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY;SPATIAL DYNAMICS;EPIDEMIOLOGY;SEQUENCES;AFRICA;EUROPE,,

To accurately identify adaptive loci, it is thus critical to account for demographic history. Theory suggests that signatures of selection can be inferred using the coalescent, following the premise that genealogies of selected loci deviate from neutral expectations. Here, we build on this theory to develop an analytical framework to identify loci under selection via explicit demographic models (LSD). Under this framework, signatures of selection are inferred through deviations in demographic parameters, rather than through summary statistics directly, and demographic history is accounted for explicitly. Leveraging the property of demographic models to incorporate directionality, we show that LSD can provide information on the environment in which selection acts on a population. This can prove useful in elucidating the selective processes underlying local adaptation, by characterizing genetic trade-offs and extending the concepts of antagonistic pleiotropy and conditional neutrality from ecological theory to practical application in genomic data. We implement LSD via approximate Bayesian computation and demonstrate, via simulations, that LSD (a) has high power to identify selected loci across a large range of demographic-selection regimes, (b) outperforms commonly applied genome-scan methods under complex demographies and (c) accurately infers the directionality of selection for identified candidates. Using the same simulations, we further characterize the behaviour of isolation-with-migration models conducive to the study of local adaptation under regimes of selection.

However, previous studies of habitat heterogeneity and local adaptation have largely been limited to simple landscapes, which poorly represent the multiscale habitat structure common in nature. Here, we use simulations to pursue two goals: (i) we explore how landscape heterogeneity, dispersal ability and selection affect the strength of local adaptation, and (ii) we evaluate the performance of several genotype-environment association (GEA) methods for detecting loci involved in local adaptation. We found that the strength of local adaptation increased in spatially aggregated selection regimes, but remained strong in patchy landscapes when selection was moderate to strong. Weak selection resulted in weak local adaptation that was relatively unaffected by landscape heterogeneity. In general, the power of detection methods closely reflected levels of local adaptation. False-positive rates (FPRs), however, showed distinct differences across GEA methods based on levels of population structure. The univariate GEA approach had high FPRs (up to 55%) under limited dispersal scenarios, due to strong isolation by distance. By contrast, multivariate, ordination-based methods had uniformly low FPRs (0-2%), suggesting these approaches can effectively control for population structure. Specifically, constrained ordinations had the best balance of high detection and low FPRs and will be a useful addition to the GEA toolkit. Our results provide both theoretical and practical insights into the conditions that shape local adaptation and how these conditions impact our ability to detect selection.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  136     Total Times Cited:  139     Cited Reference Count:  87,10.1111/mec.13476     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CDPOP;complex landscapes;genome scans;latent factor mixed model;natural selection;ordination methods;POPULATION-GENETICS;MANTEL TEST;SELECTION;FLOW;POLYMORPHISM;GENOMICS;ENVIRONMENTS;MUTATIONS;EVOLUTION;MODELS,,

One major conclusion arising from these studies is that most traits are controlled by many loci of small effect, confirming the infinitesimal model of quantitative genetics. A popular approach to test for polygenic architecture involves so-called ""chromosome partitioning"" where phenotypic variance explained by each chromosome is regressed on the size of the chromosome. First developed for humans, this has now been repeatedly used in other species, but there has been no evaluation of the suitability of this method in species that can differ in their genome characteristics such as number and size of chromosomes. Nor has the influence of sample size, heritability of the trait, effect size distribution of loci controlling the trait or the physical distribution of the causal loci in the genome been examined. Using simulated data, we show that these characteristics have major influence on the inferences of the genetic architecture of traits we can infer using chromosome partitioning analyses. In particular, small variation in chromosome size, small sample size, low heritability, a skewed effect size distribution and clustering of loci can lead to a loss of power and consequently altered inference from chromosome partitioning analyses. Future studies employing this approach need to consider and derive an appropriate null model for their study system, taking these parameters into consideration. Our simulation results can provide some guidelines on these matters, but further studies examining a broader parameter space are needed.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  21,10.1111/1755-0998.12774     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),chromosome partitioning;genomewide association studies;mesogenic;oligogenic;polygenic traits;WIDE ASSOCIATION;QUANTITATIVE TRAITS;COMMON SNPS;WILD BIRD;POPULATION;CHALLENGES;LIVESTOCK;LOCI;Sample Size;Genome;Genomics,,

Alignment-free methods are both efficient and accurate for phylogenetic reconstructions with whole genomes and are especially practical for nonmodel organisms; nonetheless, alignment-free methods have not been applied with reduced genome sequencing data.

Reads selection improved the accuracy of phylogenetic construction in every simulated scenario and the two real data sets, making AAF as good or better than a comparable alignment-based method, even though AAF had much lower computational burdens.

Here, we assess the applicability of genotyping-by-sequencing for relatedness inferences given its relatively high genotyping error rate. Individuals of known relatedness were simulated under genotyping error, allelic dropout and missing data scenarios based on an empirical ddRAD data set, and their true relatedness was compared to that estimated by seven relatedness estimators. We found that an estimator chosen through such analyses can circumvent the influence of genotyping error, with the estimator of Ritland (Genetics Research, 67, 175) shown to be unaffected by allelic dropout and to be the most accurate when there is genotyping error. We also found that the choice of estimator should not rely solely on the strength of correlation between estimated and true relatedness as a strong correlation does not necessarily mean estimates are close to true relatedness. We also demonstrated how even a large SNP data set with genotyping error (allelic dropout or otherwise) or missing data still performs better than a perfectly genotyped microsatellite data set of tens of markers.

Effective population size is important both theoretically (N-e is a key parameter in almost every aspect of evolutionary biology) and for practical application (N-e determines rates of genetic drift and loss of genetic variability and modulates the effectiveness of selection, so it is crucial to consider in conservation). As documented by Palstra & Fraser (), most of the recent growth in N-e estimation can be attributed to development or refinement of methods that can use a single sample of individuals (the older temporal method requires at least two samples separated in time). As with other population genetic methods, performance of new N-e estimators is typically evaluated with simulated data for a few scenarios selected by the author(s). Inevitably, these initial evaluations fail to fully consider the consequences of violating simplifying assumptions, such as discrete generations, closed populations of constant size and selective neutrality. Subsequently, many researchers studying natural or captive populations have reported estimates of N-e for multiple methods; often these estimates are congruent, but that is not always the case. Because true N-e is rarely known in these empirical studies, it is difficult to make sense of the results when estimates differ substantially among methods. What is needed is a rigorous, comparative analysis under realistic scenarios for which true N-e is known. Recently, Gilbert & Whitlock () did just that for both single-sample and temporal methods under a wide range of migration schemes. In the current issue of Molecular Ecology, Wang () uses simulations to evaluate performance of four single-sample N-e estimators. In addition to assessing effects of true N-e, sample size, and number of loci, Wang also evaluated performance under changing abundance, physical linkage and genotyping errors, as well as for some alternative life histories (high rates of selfing; haplodiploids). Wang showed that the sibship frequency (SF) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) methods perform dramatically better than the heterozygote excess and molecular coancestry methods under most scenarios (see Fig.1, modified from figure 2 in Wang ), and he also concluded that SF is generally more versatile than LD.

However, even if the pedigree is inferred correctly, this has the potential to do more harm than good. We used computer simulations and empirical samples of coho salmon to evaluate strategies for adjusting samples to account for family structure. We compared performance in full samples and sibling-reduced samples of estimators of allele frequency (P), population differentiation (FST) and effective population size (Ne). Results: (i) unless simulated samples included large family groups together with a component of unrelated individuals, removing siblings generally reduced precision of P and FST; (ii) Ne based on the linkage disequilibrium method was largely unbiased using full random samples but became increasingly upwardly biased under aggressive purging of siblings. Under nonrandom sampling (some families over-represented), Ne using full samples was downwardly biased; removing just the right Goldilocks' fraction of siblings could produce an unbiased estimate, but this sweet spot varied widely among scenarios; (iii) weighting individuals based on the inferred pedigree (to produce a best linear unbiased estimator, BLUE) maximized precision of P when the inferred pedigree was correct but performed poorly when the pedigree was wrong; (iv) a variant of sibling removal that leaves intact small sibling groups appears to be more robust to errors in inferences about family structure. Our results illustrate the complex challenges posed by presence of family structure, suggest that no single optimal solution exists and argue for caution in adjusting population genetic data sets for the presence of putative siblings without fully understanding the consequences.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  103     Total Times Cited:  103     Cited Reference Count:  40,10.1111/mec.14022     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),allele frequency;effective population size;family structure;genetic differentiation;precision;MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA;SIBSHIP RECONSTRUCTION;LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM;REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS;ALLELE-FREQUENCY;EFFECTIVE NUMBER;SIZE;PROGRAM;BREEDERS;CONSERVATION;Cathartics,,

The high computational overhead of likelihood-based inference approaches severely restricts their applicability to large data sets or complex models. In response to these restrictions, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods have been developed to infer the demographic past of populations and species. Here, we present the results of an evaluation of the ABC-based approach implemented in the popular software package diyabc using simulated data sets (mitochondrial DNA sequences, microsatellite genotypes and single nucleotide polymorphisms). We simulated population genetic data under five different simple, single-population models to assess the model recovery rates as well as the bias and error of the parameter estimates. The ability of diyabc to recover the correct model was relatively low (0.49): 0.6 for the simplest models and 0.3 for the more complex models. The recovery rate improved significantly when reducing the number of candidate models from five to three (from 0.57 to 0.71). Among the parameters of interest, the effective population size was estimated at a higher accuracy compared to the timing of events. Increased amounts of genetic data did not significantly improve the accuracy of the parameter estimates. Some gains in accuracy and decreases in error were observed for scaled parameters (e.g., N-e) compared to unscaled parameters (e.g., N-e and ). We concluded that diyabc-based assessments are not suited to capture a detailed demographic history, but might be efficient at capturing simple, major demographic changes.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  42     Total Times Cited:  43     Cited Reference Count:  84,10.1111/1755-0998.12696     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),approximate Bayesian computation;demographic inference;model selection;population genetics;APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION;POPULATION HISTORY;MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME;SUBSTITUTION RATE;DNA-SEQUENCE;MUTATION;MODEL;INFERENCE;DIVERGENCE;EXPANSION,,

To infer the optimal number of clusters from STRUCTURE output, the Delta K method is often applied. However, a recent study relying on simulated microsatellite data suggested that this method has a downward bias in its estimation of K and is sensitive to uneven sampling. If this finding holds for empirical data sets, conclusions about the scale of gene flow may have to be revised for a large number of studies. To determine the impact of method choice, we applied recently described estimators of K to re-estimate genetic structure in 41 empirical microsatellite data sets; 15 from a broad range of taxa and 26 from one phylogenetic group, coral. We compared alternative estimates of K (Puechmaille statistics) with traditional (Delta K and posterior probability) estimates and found widespread disagreement of estimators across data sets. Thus, one estimator alone is insufficient for determining the optimal number of clusters; this was regardless of study organism or evenness of sampling scheme. Subsequent analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) did not necessarily clarify which clustering solution was best. To better infer population structure, we suggest a combination of visual inspection of STRUCTURE plots and calculation of the alternative estimators at various thresholds in addition to Delta K.

An important aspect of palaeontological data is the uncertainty surrounding specimen ages, which can be handled in different ways during inference. The most common approach is to fix fossil ages to a point estimate within the known age interval. Alternatively, age uncertainty can be incorporated by using priors, and fossil ages are then directly sampled as part of the inference. This study presents a comparison of alternative approaches for handling fossil age uncertainty in analysis using the FBD process. Based on simulations, we find that fixing fossil ages to the midpoint or a random point drawn from within the stratigraphic age range leads to biases in divergence time estimates, while sampling fossil ages leads to estimates that are similar to inferences that employ the correct ages of fossils. Second, we show a comparison using an empirical dataset of extant and fossil cetaceans, which confirms that different methods of handling fossil age uncertainty lead to large differences in estimated node ages. Stratigraphic age uncertainty should thus not be ignored in divergence time estimation and instead should be incorporated explicitly.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  29     Total Times Cited:  29     Cited Reference Count:  51,10.1098/rspb.2019.0685     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),fossilized birth-death;stratigraphic age uncertainty;fossil data;Bayesian phylogenetics;divergence times estimation;CALIBRATION;RADIATION;MODEL;DIVERSIFICATION;PHYLOGENETICS;REVEALS;RATES;TREE,,

Our study species, Tasmanian devils, are endangered due to an infectious cancer with an 80 % reduction in population size across their range. In 2012, an island population was established to protect the species. The island population was harvested three times with devils translocated to wild location across Tasmania (2016, N = 16; 2017, N = 33; 2018, N = 30). Efforts to harvest individuals demographically representative of the source population was achievable in 2017 and 2018, with a large male bias occurring in 2016 due to logistic constraints. Using internal relatedness (IR; proxy for heterozygosity), we showed that harvesting animals in equal-sized groups of high, medium and low IR, succeeded in maintaining genetic profiles of the source population over repeated harvests. There was little within-year variation in observed heterozygosity pre- and post-harvest compared to the harvest group, and only a small reduction (0.001) in heterozygosity across years.

Using simulations of a population of annual plants, it was found that the effect of N-n on N-e was well approximated by N-e = N/(1 - F-IS), where F-IS (determined by N-n) was evaluated population wide. N-n only had a notable influence of increasing N-e as it became smaller (<= 16). In contrast, the effect of N-n on genetic estimates of N-e was substantial. Using the temporal method (a standard two-sample approach) based on 1000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and varying sampling method, sample size (2-25% of N) and interval between samples (T = 1-32 generations), estimates of N-e ranged from infinity to <0.1% of the true value (defined as N-e based on 100% sampling). Estimates were never accurate unless N-n and T were large. Three sampling techniques were tested: same-site resampling, different-site resampling and random sampling. Random sampling was the least biased method. Extremely low estimates often resulted when different-site resampling was used, especially when the population was large and the sample fraction was small, raising the possibility that this estimation bias could be a factor determining some very low N-e/N that have been published.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  28,10.1038/hdy.2016.76     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),NONRANDOM MATING POPULATIONS;GENETICS;SYSTEM;Population Density,,

For individually marked species, capture-recapture models provide robust population estimates, but for unmarked species, inference is often based on relative abundance indices (RAI, number of records per trap effort), although these do not account for imperfect and variable detection. We use a simulation study and empirical camera-trapping data to illustrate how ecological and sampling-related factors can bias RAIs. Our simulations showed that (1) differences in detection between species led to bias in RAT ratios toward the more detectable species, especially at low detection levels, (2) species with larger home ranges were photographed more often, inflating RAIs, (3) species specific responses to different types of trap setup biased RAT ratios, and (4) changes in detection over time blurred true population trends inferred from RAIs. Empirical data for leopard cats Prionailurus bengalensis and common palm civets Paradoxurus hermaphroditus showed that traps set up along roads led to higher RAIs than off-road traps, but targeting roads increased detection more for leopard cats than for common palm civets. Comparing RAIs of Sunda clouded leopards Neofelis diardi and leopard cats with spatial capture-recapture based density estimates across sites, RAIs did not reflect differences in density. Analytical options for estimating density from camera-trapping data of unmarked populations are limited. Consequently, we fear that RAIs will continue to be applied. This is alarming, since these measures often form the basis for conservation and management decisions. We suggest considering alternative analytical and survey methods, especially when dealing with threatened species. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Logistical difficulties and the spatiotemporal variability of populations make estimation of population declines difficult. For statistical reasons, estimates of population decline may be biased when study sites are chosen based on abundance of the focal species. In this situation, apparent population declines are likely to be detected even if there is no decline. This site-selection bias is mentioned in the literature but is not well known. We used simulations and real population data to examine the effects of site-selection biases on inferences about population trends. We used a left-censoring method to detect population-size patterns consistent with site-selection bias. The site-selection bias is an important consideration for conservation biologists, and we offer suggestions for minimizing or mitigating it in study design and analysis.Article impact statement: Estimates of population declines are biased if studies begin in large populations, and time-series data show a signature of such an effect.

The climatic dimensions to which a species or system is most sensitive - such as means or extremes - can guide methodological decisions for projections of ecological impacts and vulnerabilities. However, scientific workflows for combining climate projections with ecological models have received little explicit attention. We review Global Climate Model (GCM) performance along different dimensions of change and compare frameworks for integrating GCM output into ecological models. In systems sensitive to climatological means, it is straightforward to base ecological impact assessments on mean projected changes from several GCMs. Ecological systems sensitive to climatic extremes may benefit from what we term the 'model space' approach: a comparison of ecological projections based on simulated climate from historical and future time periods. This approach leverages the experimental framework used in climate modeling, in which historical climate simulations serve as controls for future projections. Moreover, it can capture projected changes in the intensity and frequency of climatic extremes, rather than assuming that future means will determine future extremes. Given the recent emphasis on the ecological impacts of climatic extremes, the strategies we describe will be applicable across species and systems. We also highlight practical considerations for the selection of climate models and data products, emphasizing that the spatial resolution of the climate change signal is generally coarser than the grid cell size of downscaled climate model output. Our review illustrates how an understanding of how climate model outputs are derived and downscaled can improve the selection and application of climatic data used in ecological modeling.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  22     Total Times Cited:  22     Cited Reference Count:  161,10.1111/gcb.13653     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),climate bias-correction;climate change impacts;climate extremes;climate variability;delta method;ecological projections;STOCHASTIC WEATHER GENERATORS;HYDROLOGICALLY BASED DATASET;NORTH-AMERICAN CLIMATE;LAND-SURFACE FLUXES;PRECIPITATION EXTREMES;HEAVY-PRECIPITATION;CHANGE SCENARIOS;IMPROVE PREDICTIONS;DAILY TEMPERATURE;BIAS CORRECTION,,

The high overestimation of LAI-MODIS compared to field measurements was corrected based on the calibration of high-resolution Satellites Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) images combined with ground measurements. The LAI-MODIS time series over the 2003 to 2009 period has been calibrated and integrated into a spatially explicit water budget model at the regional level using spatial information on vegetation, soil types and topoclimates. Actual LAI-MODIS scenario was tested against temporal and spatial null models to assess for the benefits of the regional heterogeneity from MODIS and its intra-annual and interannual variation in a water budget model. From water budget analyses at local and regional scales, we concluded that calibration of LAI-MODIS images was mandatory to enhance the correlation coefficient between measured and simulated daily actual transpiration. We estimated daily bias in the resulting Water Stress Index' to be slightly affected between constant and seasonally-varying LAI datasets. However, the interannual variability in LAI detected by MODIS followed LAI adjustments expected from the ecohydrological equilibrium hypothesis. This can significantly affect the simulated annual drought period features, so that integrating LAI-MODIS spatial and temporal variability into water budget models for evergreen Mediterranean vegetation can be a useful dataset when carbon allocation schemes in dynamic vegetation models are lacking, but should be carefully calibrated particularly in transitions towards semi-arid zones.

The adoption of farm management practices that minimise herbicide transport in rainfall-runoff is a priority for the Australian sugarcane industry, particularly in the coastal catchments draining into the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. In this study, residual herbicide runoff and infiltration were measured using a rainfall simulator in a replicated trial on a brown Chromosol with 90-100% cane trash blanket cover in the Mackay Whitsunday region, Queensland. Management treatments included conventional 1.5 m spaced sugarcane beds with a single row of sugarcane (CONV) and 2 m spaced, controlled traffic sugarcane beds with dual sugarcane rows (0.8 m apart) (2mCT). The aim was to simulate the first rainfall event after the application of the photosynthesis inhibiting (PSII) herbicides ametryn, atrazine, diuron and hexazinone, by broadcast (100% coverage, on bed and furrow) and banding (50-60% coverage, on bed only) methods. These events included heavy rainfall 1 day after herbicide application, considered a worst case scenario, or rainfall 21 days after application. The 2mCT rows had significantly (P < 0.05) less runoff (38%) and lower peak runoff rates (43%) than CONV rows for a rainfall average of 93 mm at 100 mm h(-1) (1:20 yr Average Return Interval). Additionally, final infiltration rates were higher in 2mCT rows than CONV rows, with 72 and 52 mm h-1 respectively. This resulted in load reductions of 60, 55, 47, and 48% for ametryn, atrazine, diuron and hexazinone from 2 mCT rows, respectively. Herbicide losses in runoff were also reduced by 32-42% when applications were banded rather than broadcast. When rainfall was experienced 1 day after application, a large percentage of herbicides were washed off the cane trash. However, by day 21, concentrations of herbicide residues on cane trash were lower and more resistant to washoff, resulting in lower losses in runoff. Consequently, ametryn and atrazine event mean concentrations in runoff were approximately 8 fold lower at day 21 compared with day 1, whilst diuron and hexazinone were only 1.6-1.9 fold lower, suggesting longer persistence of these chemicals. Runoff collected at the end of the paddock in natural rainfall events indicated consistent though smaller treatment differences to the rainfall simulation study. Overall, it was the combination of early application, banding and controlled traffic that was most effective in reducing herbicide losses in runoff.

Reconstructed phylogenies often show decelerated lineage accumulation over time. This pattern has often been interpreted as the result of diversity-dependent (DD) diversification, where the accumulation of species causes diversification to decrease through niche filling. However, other processes can also produce such a slowdown, including time dependence without diversity dependence. To test whether phylogenetic branching patterns can be used to distinguish these two mechanisms, we formulated a time-dependent, but diversity-independent model that matches the expected diversity through time of a DD model. We simulated phylogenies under each model and studied how well likelihood methods could recover the true diversification mode. Standard model selection criteria always recovered diversity dependence, even when it was not present. We correct for this bias by using a bootstrap method and find that neither model is decisively supported. This implies that the branching pattern of reconstructed trees contains insufficient information to detect the presence or absence of diversity dependence. We advocate that tests encompassing additional data, for example, traits or range distributions, are needed to evaluate how diversity drives macroevolutionary trends.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  56,10.1111/evo.14124,Birth&#8208;death models;diversity dependence;macroevolution;maximum likelihood;simulations;time dependence;MOLECULAR PHYLOGENIES;SPECIES-DIVERSITY;EXTINCTION RATES;EVOLUTION;RADIATION;DYNAMICS;SPECIATION;CLADOGENESIS;ORIGIN;LIMITS,,

However, efficient monitoring of many large carnivore species is challenging due to their rarity, elusive behavior, and large home ranges. Their monitoring can include opportunistic sightings from citizens in addition to designed surveys. Two types of detection errors may occur in such monitoring schemes: false negatives and false positives. False-negative detections can be accounted for in species distribution models (SDMs) that deal with imperfect detection. False-positive detections, due to species misidentification, have rarely been accounted for in SDMs. Generally, researchers use ad hoc data-filtering methods to discard ambiguous observations prior to analysis. These practices may discard valuable ecological information on the distribution of a species. We investigated the costs and benefits of including data types that may include false positives rather than discarding them for SDMs of large carnivores. We used a dynamic occupancy model that simultaneously accounts for false negatives and positives to jointly analyze data that included both unambiguous detections and ambiguous detections. We used simulations to compare the performances of our model with a model fitted on unambiguous data only. We tested the 2 models in 4 scenarios in which parameters that control false-positive detections and true detections varied. We applied our model to data from the monitoring of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in the European Alps. The addition of ambiguous detections increased the precision of parameter estimates. For the Eurasian lynx, incorporating ambiguous detections produced more precise estimates of the ecological parameters and revealed additional occupied sites in areas where the species is likely expanding.

We compare differences in disparity metrics and ordination spaces produced by linkage and random character removal. When we incorporated linkage among characters, disparity metrics declined and ordination spaces shrank at a slower rate with increasing missing data, indicating that correlations among characters govern the sensitivity of disparity analysis. We also present and test a new disparity method that uses the linkage algorithm to correct for the bias caused by missing data.

We present an empirical and theoretical evaluation of multiple data source sampling as a flexible and effective way to improve the performance of capture-recapture models for abundance estimation of small populations. We integrated three data sources to estimate the size of the relict Apennine brown bear (Ursus arctos marsicanus) population in central Italy, and supported our results with simulations to assess the robustness of multiple data source capture-recapture models to violations of main assumptions. During May-August 2008, we non-invasively sampled bears using systematic hair traps on a grid of 41 5 x 5 km cells, moving trap locations between five sampling sessions. We also live-trapped, ear-tagged, and genotyped 17 bears (2004-2008), and integrated resights of marked bears and family units (July-September 2008) into a multiple data source capture-recapture dataset. Population size was estimated at 40 (95% CI = 37-52) bears, with a corresponding closure-corrected density of 32 bears/1000 km(2) (95% CI = 28-36). Given the average capture probability we obtained with all data sources combined ((p) over cap = 0.311), simulations suggested that the expected degree of correlation among data sources did not seriously affect model performance, with expected level of bias <5%. Our results refine previous simulation work on larger populations, cautioning on the combined effect of lack of independence and low capture probability in application of multiple data source sampling to very small populations (N < 100).

The occurrences of a dead zone and short-circuiting flow decrease flow uniformity and might decrease hydraulic performance. This study aims to investigate the relationship between spatial flow characteristics and wetland treatment performance. A hydrodynamic and contaminant transport model conducted ten sets of simulations with different water depths and five sets of simulations with varying numbers of emergent obstructions. Each experiment had a variant number, dimension, and allocation of obstructions. A metric of flow uniformity was proposed and discussed. We demonstrated how the dead zone and short-circuiting alter flow conditions and affect the hydraulic performance and pollutant treatment efficiency by examining the flow characteristics. The order-of-magnitude of time scales between the advective transport rate and diffusive transport rate was analyzed by calculating the Peclet number. The first-order model was used to calculate the pollutant removal ratio. The results revealed that the values of advection were approximately tens to hundreds of times those of diffusion, indicating that the flow velocity dominated the dispersion behavior. The significant improvement in flow uniformity was found when emergent obstructions were installed. The index value of the dead zone was 2 to 69 times that of the short-circuiting flow, which shows that the dead zone significantly affected the uniformity of the flow. In addition, we discovered that when the coverage ratio of the dead zone was less than 50%, the hydraulic efficiency increased from 0.55 to 1.00. Nevertheless, the short-circuiting flow was found to have minor effects on the hydraulic efficiency. The new methodology for distinguishing dead zones and short-circuiting flow areas is useful for evaluating hydraulic performance directly instead of executing water quality modeling or tracer experiments.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  39,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.105942     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Constructed wetlands;Flow velocity;Advective transport;Dead zone;Short-circuiting flow;Hydraulic performance;WASTE-WATER;EFFICIENCY;REMOVAL;SYSTEM;PONDS;Metronidazole,,

While a few methods have been developed to infer admixture history based on ancestral tracks, these methods suffer the same flaw: only population admixture history under some specific models can be inferred. In addition, the inference of history might be biased or even unreliable if the specific model deviates from the real situation. To address this problem, we firstly proposed a general discrete admixture model to describe the admixture history with multiple ancestral populations and multiple-wave admixtures. We next deduced the length distribution of ancestral tracks under the general discrete admixture model. We further developed a new method, MultiWaver, to explore multiple-wave admixture histories. Our method could automatically determine an optimal admixture model based on the length distribution of ancestral tracks, and estimate the corresponding parameters under this optimal model. Specifically, we used a likelihood ratio test (LRT) to determine the number of admixture waves, and implemented an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate parameters. We used simulation studies to validate the reliability and effectiveness of our method.

The actual intensity of grazing and fire, along with the timing of the interventions, however, are difficult to determine in practice. Objectives This study aims to establish model simulations to access the long-term landscape changes under different land management scenarios. Methods We developed a cellular automata model to evaluate landscape dynamics in response to scenarios of grazing, fire, time of intervention, and initial coverage of grasses and shrubs. Results With current grazing intensity and fire suppression, the landscape may shift to a shrub-dominated landscape in 100-150 years. An appropriate combination of grazing and fire management could help maintain over 50% of grass cover and reduce the shrub cover to less than 2%, keeping the landscape highly reversible. Even using 1% grazing intensity and periodic fire once a year, the management tools should be implemented in 60 years, otherwise, they may lose effectiveness and the vegetation transition to grasslands would become impossible. Conclusions This study highlighted that the reintroduction of fire not only directly removes shrubs but also reallocates soil water and resources among different microsites, which may accelerate grass recovery and suppress shrub regrowth, potentially reversing the shrub invasion process. The combined grazing and fire management plans should be carried out before a threshold time depending on the chosen management tools.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  62,10.1007/s10980-019-00873-0     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Shrub encroachment;Cellular automata model;Reversibility;Arid and semiarid;Landscape dynamics;CELLULAR-AUTOMATA;PLANT ENCROACHMENT;LAND-USE;SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY;ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE;VEGETATION CHANGES;CHIHUAHUAN DESERT;WIND EROSION;SOIL;DYNAMICS,,

This method has been commonly applied to data sets containing 10-100 loci to inform conservation and study population demography. Performance of these N-e estimates could be improved by incorporating data from thousands of loci. However, these thousands of loci exist on a limited number of chromosomes, ensuring that some fraction will be physically linked. Linked loci have elevated LD due to limited recombination, which if not accounted for can cause N-e estimates to be downwardly biased. Here, we present results from coalescent and forward simulations designed to evaluate the bias of LD-based N-e estimates ((N) over cap (e)). Contrary to common perceptions, increasing the number of loci does not increase the magnitude of linkage. Although we show it is possible to identify some pairs of loci that produce unusually large r(2) values, simply removing large r(2) values is not a reliable way to eliminate bias. Fortunately, the magnitude of bias in (N) over cap (e) is strongly and negatively correlated with the process of recombination, including the number of chromosomes and their length, and this relationship provides a general way to adjust for bias. Additionally, we show that with thousands of loci, precision of (N) over cap (e) is much lower than expected based on the assumption that each pair of loci provides completely independent information.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  109     Total Times Cited:  110     Cited Reference Count:  43,10.1038/hdy.2016.60     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CONSERVATION;TOOL;EVOLUTION;INFERENCE;PATTERNS;PROGRAM;GENOMES;Linkage Disequilibrium;Population Density,,

Biases such as sampling and rock availability are commonly accounted for in large-scale studies; however, preservation bias is usually dealt with only in smaller, more focused studies. Birds represent a diverse, but taphonomically fragile, group commonly used to infer environmental conditions in recent (Pleistocene and later) fossil assemblages, and their relative scarcity in the fossil record has led to controversy over the timing of their radiation. Here, I use simulations to show how even weak taphonomic biases can distort estimates of richness, and render variance sensitive to sample size. I then apply an ecology-based filtering model to recent bird assemblages to quantify the distortion induced by taphonomy. Certain deposit types, such as caves, show less evidence of taphonomic distortion than others, such as fluvial and lacustrine deposits. Archaeological middens unsurprisingly show some of the strongest evidence for taphonomic bias, and they should be avoided when reconstructing Pleistocene and early Holocene environments. Further, these results support previously suggested methods for detecting fossil assemblages that are relatively faithfully preserved (e.g., presence of difficult-to-preserve taxa), and I use these results to recommend that future large-scale studies include facies diversity along with metrics such as rock volume, or compare only sites with similar taphonomic histories.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  41,10.1017/pab.2014.23     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),FOSSIL RECORD;COMPLETENESS;FIDELITY;ASSEMBLAGES;DIVERSITY;ABUNDANCE;REMAINS;LOSSES;COMMON;TAXA;Bias (Epidemiology),,

We agree that marker density and levels of LD are important considerations when designing a RADseq study; however, we dispute that RAD-based genome scans are as prone to failure as Lowry et al. suggest. Their arguments ignore the flexible nature of RADseq; the availability of different restriction enzymes and capacity for combining restriction enzymes ensures that a well- designed study should be able to generate enough markers for efficient genome coverage.

These are motivated by a mathematical equivalence between electrical resistance between two nodes of a network and the 'commute time', which is the mean time for a random walk on that network to leave one node, visit the other, and return. However, genetic data are more accurately modelled by a different quantity, the coalescence time. Here, we describe the differences between resistance distance and coalescence time, and explore the consequences for inference. We implemented a Bayesian method to infer effective movement rates and population sizes under both these models, and found that inference using commute times could produce misleading results in the presence of biased gene flow.

Fossil collections made from well-indurated rocks consistently exhibit lower species richness, lower evenness, and larger average specimen size relative to collections made from unconsolidated sediments, even when collections are drawn from the same assemblage. This phenomenon is known as ""lithification bias."" While the bias itself has been demonstrated empirically, much less attention has been paid to its causes. Proposed causes include taphonomic processes (e.g., destruction of small specimens during early diagenesis) and methodological differences (e.g., sieving vs. counting specimens on outcrops, bedding surfaces, or mechanically split surfaces). Here we investigate the potential effects of preferential intersection that could also result in a methodologically related bias: the preferential sampling of larger specimens relative to smaller ones when fossils are counted on rock surfaces. We used an analogue model to simulate preferential intersection (fossil collection via splitting fossiliferous rocks) and compare the results with a random-draw model that approximates the effects of sieving. The model was parameterized using nine different combinations of species abundance and species size distributions. The results show that, with rare exceptions, species richness is 5-23% lower, evenness 5-25% lower, and average specimen size 24-150% larger in preferential-intersection than in random-draw simulations. We conclude that preferential intersection can impose a significant bias independent of other mechanisms (e.g., preferential destruction of smaller specimens during diagenetic or sampling processes), that the magnitude of this bias is partially dependent on the species abundance and size distributions, and that this bias alone does not fully account for empirically observed lithification bias on species richness (i.e., other sources of bias are also at work).",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  30,10.1017/pab.2017.39     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ARAGONITE DISSOLUTION;FOSSIL RECORD;LARGE-SCALE;DIVERSITY;DISTRIBUTIONS;ASSEMBLAGES;PATTERNS;MOLLUSKS;IMPACT;ABUNDANCE;Bias (Epidemiology),,

Consequently, few data analysis computer programs are applicable to autopolyploids. To contribute bridging this gap, this article first derives theoretical expectations for the inbreeding and identity disequilibrium coefficients under polysomic inheritance in a mixed mating model. Moment estimators of these coefficients are proposed when exact genotypes or just markers phenotypes (i. e. allelic dosage unknown) are available. This led to the development of estimators of the selfing rate based on adult genotypes or phenotypes and applicable to any even-ploidy level. Their statistical performances and robustness were assessed by numerical simulations. Contrary to inbreeding-based estimators, the identity disequilibrium-based estimator using phenotypes is robust (absolute bias generally < 0.05), even in the presence of double reduction, null alleles or biparental inbreeding due to isolation by distance. A fairly good precision of the selfing rate estimates (root mean squared error < 0.1) is already achievable using a sample of 30-50 individuals phenotyped at 10 loci bearing 5-10 alleles each, conditions reachable using microsatellite markers. Diallelic markers (e. g. SNP) can also perform satisfactorily in diploids and tetraploids but more polymorphic markers are necessary for higher ploidy levels. The method is implemented in the software SPAGeDi and should contribute to reduce the lack of population genetics tools applicable to autopolyploids.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  24     Total Times Cited:  25     Cited Reference Count:  28,10.1111/1755-0998.12431     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"double reduction;identity disequilibrium;inbreeding;polyploidy;selfing;statistical performances;EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES;DOUBLE REDUCTION;INHERITANCE;SEGREGATION;POLYPLOIDY;COEFFICIENTS;TETRAPLOIDS;ANGIOSPERMS;PROGRAM;PLANTS;Genetics, Population",,

We simulated data of different population models with various total missingness (1%, 10%, 20%) introduced either randomly or biased among individuals or populations. We found that individuals biased with missing data would be dragged away from their real population clusters to the origin of PCA plots, making them indistinguishable from true admixed individuals and potentially leading to misinterpreted population structure.

We filtered three data sets with 19.12%, 9.87%, and 1.35% total missingness, all showing nonrandom missing data with biased individuals dragged towards the PCA origin, consistent with results from simulations. We highlight the importance of considering missing data effects on PCA in non-model systems where nonrandom missing data are common due to varying sample quality. To help detect missing data effects, we suggest to (1) plot PCA with a colour gradient showing per sample missingness, (2) interpret samples close to the PCA origin with extra caution, (3) explore filtering parameters with and without the missingness-biased samples, and (4) use complementary analyses (e.g., model-based methods) to cross-validate PCA results and help interpret population structure.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  37,10.1111/1755-0998.13498,next-generation sequencing;population structure;principal component analysis;RADseq;BAT EPTESICUS-FUSCUS;RADSEQ;FORMAT;Bias (Epidemiology),,

If, however, PCR success is sex-biased, naively using NGS could lead to a biased sex ratio estimator. We measured PCR success rates and error rates for amplifying the W and Z chromosomes from greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) faecal samples, examined how success and error rates for sex identification changed in response to faecal sample exposure time, and used simulation models to evaluate precision and bias of three sex assignment criteria for estimating population sex ratio with variable sample sizes and levels of PCR replication. We found PCR success rates were higher for females than males and that choice of sex assignment criteria influenced the bias and precision of corresponding sex ratio estimates. Our simulations demonstrate the importance of considering the interplay between the sex bias of PCR success, number of genotyping replicates, sample size, true population sex ratio and accuracy of assignment rules for designing future studies.

Using occurrence data from the Paleobiology Database, I identify genera that have a significant affinity for carbonate or terrigenous clastic depositional environments that transcends the Database's representation of these environments during the stratigraphic range of each genus. These affinity assignments are not a matter of arbitrarily subdividing a continuum in preference; rather, genera form distinct, nonrandom subsets with respect to environmental preference. I tabulate the stage-by-stage transitions in range size within individual genera and the stage-by-stage changes in the extent of each environment. Comparing the two shows that genera with a preference for a given environment are more likely to increase in geographic range, and to show a larger average increase in range, when that environment increases in areal extent, and likewise for decreases in geographic range and environmental area. Similar results obtain for genera with preferences for reefal and non-reef settings. Simulations and subsampling experiments suggest that these results are not artifacts of methodology or sampling bias. Nor are they confined to particular higher taxa. Genera with roughly equal preference for carbonates and clastics do not have substantially broader geographic ranges than those with a distinct affinity, suggesting that, at this scale of analysis, spatial extent of preferred environment outweighs breadth of environmental preference in governing geographic range. These results pertain to changes over actual geologic time within individual genera, not overall average ranges. Recent work has documented a regular expansion and contraction when absolute time is ignored and genera are superimposed to form a composite average. Environmental preference may contribute to this pattern, but its role appears to be minor, limited mainly to the initial expansion and final contraction of relatively short-lived genera.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  23     Cited Reference Count:  60,10.1666/13056     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),LATITUDINAL DIVERSITY GRADIENT;ORDOVICIAN RADIATION;SPECIES-LEVEL;CRETACEOUS MOLLUSKS;NICHE CONSERVATISM;BIOTIC INVASION;OHIO REGION;EXTINCTION;DYNAMICS;BIVALVES;Animal Shells;Animals;Military Personnel,,

However, plant mating systems often depart from half-sib assumptions, this can bias h2 estimates. Here, we investigate how to accurately estimate h2 in nonmodel species through the analysis of sibling designs with a moderate genotyping effort. We performed simulations to investigate how microsatellite marker information available for only a subset of offspring can improve h2 estimates based on maternal progeny designs in the presence of nonrandom mating, inbreeding in the parental population or maternal effects. We compared the basic family method, considering or not adjustments based on average relatedness coefficients, and methods based on the animal model. The animal model was used with average relatedness information, or with hybrid relatedness information: associating one-generation pedigree and family assumptions, or associating one-generation pedigree and average relatedness coefficients. Our results highlighted that methods using marker-based relatedness coefficients performed as well as pedigree-based methods in the presence of nonrandom mating (i.e. unequal male reproductive contributions, selfing), offering promising prospects to investigate insitu heritabilities in natural populations. In the presence of maternal effects, only the use of pairwise relatednesses through pedigree information improved the accuracy of h2 estimates. In that case, the amount of father-related offspring in the sibling design is the most critical. Overall, we showed that the method using both one-generation pedigree and average relatedness coefficients was the most robust to various ecological scenarios.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  50,10.1111/1755-0998.12536     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"heritability;inbreeding;marker-based relatednesses;maternal effects;pedigree-free methods;unequal reproductive success;SPATIAL GENETIC-STRUCTURE;NATURAL-POPULATIONS;TREE POPULATIONS;PEDIGREE RECONSTRUCTION;QUANTITATIVE TRAITS;MOLECULAR MARKERS;MATING SYSTEM;ANIMAL-MODELS;RELATEDNESS;FLOW;Genotype;Polymorphism, Genetic",,

As with all high-throughput technologies, it is critical to understand which analytic strategies are best suited and which parameters may bias the interpretation of the data. Here we use a comprehensive simulation approach to explore how various features of the transcriptome (complexity, degree of polymorphism p, alternative splicing), technological processing (sequencing error e, library normalization) and bioinformatic workflow (de novo vs. mapping assembly, reference genome quality) impact transcriptome quality and inference of differential gene expression (DE). We find that transcriptome assembly and gene expression profiling (EdgeR vs. BaySeq software) works well even in the absence of a reference genome and is robust across a broad range of parameters. We advise against library normalization and in most situations advocate mapping assemblies to an annotated genome of a divergent sister clade, which generally outperformed de novo assembly (Trans-Abyss, Trinity, Soapdenovo-Trans). Transcriptome complexity (size, paralogs, alternative splicing isoforms) negatively affected the assembly and DE profiling, whereas the effects of sequencing error and polymorphism were almost negligible. Finally, we highlight the challenge of gene name assignment for de novo assemblies, the importance of mapping strategies and raise awareness of challenges associated with the quality of reference genomes. Overall, our results have significant practical and methodological implications and can provide guidance in the design and analysis of RNA-seq experiments, particularly for organisms where genomic background information is lacking.",Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  158     Total Times Cited:  159     Cited Reference Count:  44,10.1111/mec.12014     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),bioinformatics;comparative genomics;differential gene expression;RNA-seq;simulation;systems biology;transcriptome assembly;GENOME;PERFORMANCE;EVOLUTION;SELECTION;ALIGNMENT;ACCURACY;LENGTH;Gene Expression;Transcriptome;Computer Simulation,,

Individual learning, unbiased and biased social learning, mixed learning, and learning schedules are considered. A rapidly changing environment or frequent migration in a spatially heterogeneous environment favors individual learning over unbiased social learning. However, results are not so straightforward in the context of learning schedules or when biases in social learning are introduced. The three major methods of modeling temporal environmental change coevolutionary, two-timescale, and information decay are compared and shown to sometimes yield contradictory results. The so-called Rogers' paradox is inherent in the two-timescale method as originally applied to the evolution of pure strategies, but is often eliminated when the other methods are used. Moreover, Rogers' paradox is not observed for the mixed learning strategies and learning schedules that we review. We believe that further theoretical work is necessary on learning schedules and biased social learning, based on models that are logically consistent and empirically pertinent. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
