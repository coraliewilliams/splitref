However, this ability comes with the disadvantage that they can only be applied to new data if these are similar to the training data. Since spatial mapping requires predictions to new geographic space which in many cases goes along with new predictor properties, a method to assess the area to which a prediction model can be reliably applied is required. Here, we suggest a methodology that delineates the 'area of applicability' (AOA) that we define as the area where we enabled the model to learn about relationships based on the training data, and where the estimated cross-validation performance holds. We first propose a 'dissimilarity index' (DI) that is based on the minimum distance to the training data in the multidimensional predictor space, with predictors being weighted by their respective importance in the model. The AOA is then derived by applying a threshold which is the (outlier-removed) maximum DI of the training data derived via cross-validation. We further use the relationship between the DI and the cross-validation performance to map the estimated performance of predictions. We illustrate the approach in a simulated case study chosen to mimic ecological realities and test the credibility by using a large set of simulated data. The simulation studies showed that the prediction error within the AOA is comparable to the cross-validation error of the trained model, while the cross-validation error does not apply outside the AOA. This applies to models being trained with randomly distributed training data, as well as when training data are clustered in space and where spatial cross-validation is applied. Using the relationship between DI and cross-validation performance showed potential to limit predictions to the area where a user-defined performance applies. We suggest to add the AOA computation to the modeller's standard toolkit and to present predictions for the AOA only. We further suggest to report a map of DI-dependent performance estimates alongside prediction maps and complementary to (cross-)validation performance measures and the common uncertainty estimates.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  43     Total Times Cited:  43     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-LABELS: not statistical models | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/2041-210X.13650,machine learning;model transferability;predictive modelling;Random Forest;remote sensing;spatial mapping;uncertainty;CROSS-VALIDATION;PERFORMANCE;UNCERTAINTY;STRATEGIES;ACCURACY;FOREST;DOMAIN;RANGE;BIAS,,

Genetic monitoring can be an effective approach for acquiring this important demographic information when traditional methods are unsuccessful, inefficient, or too expensive. This study demonstrates a novel application of genetic data opportunistically collected from harvested game to estimate a minimum annual count of breeding packs of gray wolves (Canis lupus) and to provide a coarse index of harvest vulnerability of young of the year (YOY) across packs. We used 18 microsatellite loci to genotype 98 gray wolf YOY from 2014 and 105 from 2015 harvested in Idaho, USA. Using this genotype data, we reconstructed sibling groups for each cohort using the program COLONY and treated full-sibling litters as proxies for unique packs. In addition to evaluating our marker panel using simulations, we assessed the accuracy of empirical relationship assignments by adding YOY of known relationship from long-term study packs to the dataset (27 individuals from 2014 and 61 from 2015) and tracking correctly reconstructed relationships. We varied COLONY input parameters to evaluate the power of relationship assignments under conditions that may be encountered when working with empirical data. We also compared COLONY's estimates of effective number of breeders based on sibship frequency to estimates based on a commonly used linkage-disequilibrium method. All COLONY runs for both cohorts correctly identified the known sibling relationships. Among the other individuals, changes in the geographic clustering of putative siblings, probabilities of inclusion and exclusion for reconstructed sibling groups, and consistency of relationship assignments across COLONY runs suggested that marker number had a larger effect on accuracy than access to population-level genetic data. Our estimates of breeding packs subjected to harvest within the state (52 for 2014 and 63 for 2015) differed from estimates reported by Idaho Department of Fish and Game by <= 6 for both years. Among packs that had pups harvested, most packs had 1-2 YOY harvested, whereas other packs had as many as 5 YOY harvested. All estimates of the number of effective breeders had overlapping confidence intervals regardless of method, though sibship frequency-based estimates had larger confidence intervals than estimates using the linkage disequilibrium method. Our study shows that sibling relationships can be accurately and reliably reconstructed from harvested gray wolves, and demonstrates a valuable new use of samples collected through harvest.

CladeDate uses simple mathematical models to estimate the age of a clade and its uncertainty based on fossil times. Using a Monte Carlo approach, CladeDate generates empirical densities representing the uncertainty associated with the age of the clade and fits standard probability density functions that can be used in time-tree inference software such as BEAST2, MrBayes and MCMCtree. I show with simulations that the calibration information generated with CladeDate produces accurate time-trees and compares favourably with more complex methods. I demonstrate the use CladeDate for the generation of calibration information, including point estimates, upper bounds and calibration densities, for passerine birds. CladeDate is particularly suited for groups with limited fossil information or when assumptions of more complex methods are not met, and provides a general and practical solution to the problem of generating calibration information for divergence time estimation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/2041-210X.13977,calibration densities;divergence time estimation;empirical priors;fossil dating;fossil record;PHYLOGENETIC ESTIMATION;STRATIGRAPHIC RANGES;CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS;FOSSIL CALIBRATIONS;MASS EXTINCTION;UNCERTAINTY;EVOLUTION;INFERENCE;CLOCKS;MODEL;Calibration,,

Applying phylogeny-based analyses of trait evolution and diversification in the fossil record generally involves transforming an unscaled cladogram into a phylogeny scaled to geologic time. Current methods produce single time-scaled phylogenies with no indication of the uncertainty in the temporal relationships and, under some methods, artificial zero-length branches.        2. Here, I present a stochastic algorithm for time-scaling phylogenies of fossil taxa by randomly sampling node ages from a constrained distribution, with the ultimate goal of producing large samples of time-scaled phylogenies for a given data set as the basis for phylogeny-based analyses. I describe how this stochastic approach can be extended to consider potential ancestral relationships and resolve polytomies.        3. The stochastic selection of node ages in this algorithm is weighted by the probability density of the total inferable unobserved evolutionary history at single divergence events in a tree, a distribution dependent on rates of branching, extinction and sampling in the fossil record.        4. The combined time-scaling method must be calibrated with explicit estimates of three rates: branching, extinction and sampling, and thus is named the cal3 time-scaling method, included in the r library paleotree. I test the time-scaling capabilities of the cal3 and older time-scaling methods in simulations. cal3 produces samples of time-scaled trees that better bracket the uncertainty in the true node ages than existing time-scaling methods. This is true even in simulations under a terminal-taxon' model of differentiation that violates many of the assumptions of the cal3 method.        5. The cal3 method provides a new approach for time-scaling palaeontological cladograms, calibrated to estimated sampling and diversification rates, allowing for better estimates of uncertainty in the phylogenetic time-scaling. The cal3 method is robust to relaxation of at least some model assumptions. Additional work is needed to analyse the impact of time-scaling approaches on macroevolutionary analyses and to integrate time-scaling with phylogenetic inference.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  85     Total Times Cited:  85     Cited Reference Count:  40 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Maybe""}",10.1111/2041-210X.12081     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),cladistics;comparative methods;diversification;extinct lineages;fossil time-trees;incomplete sampling;palaeontology;CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS;BODY-SIZE;EVOLUTIONARY;RECORD;PROBABILITY;RADIATION;ORIGINS;Calibration,,

Current approaches involve buffering survey locations with polygons of various sizes and using model selection to identify the best scale. The buffering approach does not acknowledge that the influence of surrounding landscape features should diminish with distance, and it does not yield an estimate of the unknown scale parameters.        The purpose of this paper is to present an approach that allows for statistical inference about the scales at which landscape variables affect abundance.        Our method uses smoothing kernels to average landscape variables around focal sites and uses maximum likelihood to estimate the scale parameters of the kernels and the effects of the smoothed variables on abundance. We assessed model performance using a simulation study and an avian point count dataset.        The simulation study demonstrated that estimators are unbiased and produce correct confidence interval coverage except in the rare case in which there is little spatial autocorrelation in the landscape variable. Canada warbler abundance was more highly correlated with site-level measures of NDVI than landscape-level NDVI, but the reverse was true for elevation. Canada warbler abundance was highest when elevation in the surrounding landscape, defined by an estimated Gaussian kernel, was between 1300 and 1400 m.        Our method provides a rigorous way of formally estimating the scales at which landscape variables affect abundance, and it can be embedded within most classes of statistical models.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  36     Total Times Cited:  36     Cited Reference Count:  38 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s10980-016-0380-z     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Appalachian Mountains;Cardellina canadensis;Habitat selection;Kernel smoothing;Moving window analysis;Characteristic scale;SPECIES-ENVIRONMENT RELATIONSHIPS;CONNECTIVITY MEASURES;POPULATION-SIZE;BIRD ABUNDANCE;MODELS;ASSOCIATIONS;DISTANCE,,

Advances in methodology typically are focused on either the design or the modelling stage of the study but do not involve integration of both. We integrate adaptive cluster sampling and spatial occupancy modelling by developing two models to handle the dependence induced by cluster sampling. We compare these models to scenarios using simple random sampling and traditional occupancy models via simulation and data collected on a rare plant species, Tamarix ramosissima, found in China. Our simulations show a marked improvement in confidence interval coverage for the new models combined with cluster sampling compared to simple random sampling and traditional occupancy models, with greatest improvement in the presence of low detection probability and spatial correlation in occupancy. Accounting for the design using the simple cluster random-effects model reduces bias considerably, and full spatial modelling reduces bias further, especially for large n when the spatial covariance parameters can be estimated reliably. Both new models build on the strength of occupancy modelling and adaptive sampling and perform at least as well, and often better, than occupancy modelling alone.

These methods allow for the statistical comparison of evolutionary rates, assessment of phylogenetic signal, and tests of correlated high-dimensional trait evolution. Simulations reveal that distance-based comparative methods exhibit low statistical power and high Type I error under various evolutionary scenarios. Distance-based methods are also limited to relatively simple model specification (e.g., Brownian motion evolution) due to the lack of a likelihood function for parameter estimation. Here I propose an alternative method for studying high-dimensional trait evolution which overcomes some of the statistical limitations associated with distance-based methods. This framework, based on parametric bootstrapping and maximum pseudolikelihood parameter estimation, opens up the ability to estimate alternative evolutionary models, combine multiple evolutionary hypotheses, and potentially allow missing data and within-species variation. Simulations reveal that pairwise composite likelihood methods demonstrate appropriate Type I error and high statistical power, thus providing a robust framework for studying high-dimensional trait evolution.

The species-pairs evolutionary lag test (SPELT) uses an independent contrasts based approach to detect evolutionary lag on a phylogeny. We investigated the statistical performance of SPELT in relation to degree of lag, sample size (species pairs), and strength of association between traits. We simulated trait evolution under two models: one in which trait X changes during speciation and the lagging trait Y catches up as a function of time since speciation; and another in which trait X evolves in a random walk and the lagging trait Y is a function of X at a previous time period. Type I error rates under no lag were close to the expected level of 5%, indicating that the method is not prone to false-positives. Simulation results suggest that reasonable statistical power (80%) is reached with around 140 species pairs, although the degree of lag and trait associations had additional influences on power.

However, this approach has potential pitfalls: over conservativeness after Bonferroni correction, ignorance of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between neighboring markers, and power reduction due to overfitting SNP effects. So, multiple locus models that can simultaneously estimate and test all markers in the genome are more appropriate. Based on the multiple locus models, we proposed a bin model that combines markers into bins based on their LD relationships. A bin is treated as a new synthetic marker and we detect the associations between bins and traits. Since the number of bins can be substantially smaller than the number of markers, a penalized multiple regression method can be adopted by fitting all bins to a single model. We developed an innovative method to bin the neighboring markers and used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. We compared BIN-Lasso with SNP-Lasso and Q + K-LMM in a simulation experiment, and showed that the new method is more powerful with less Type I error than the other two methods. We also applied the bin model to a Chinese Simmental beef cattle population for bone weight association study. The new method identified more significant associations than the classical LMM. The bin model is a new dimension reduction technique that takes advantage of biological information (i.e., LD). The new method will be a significant breakthrough in associative genomics in the big data era.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  36 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1038/s41437-019-0279-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),VARIABLE SELECTION;RIDGE-REGRESSION;MODEL;REGULARIZATION;SHRINKAGE;FRAMEWORK;TRAITS;Genome;Genomics;Genotype,,

Detection is by means of stationary devices such as traps, automatic cameras or DNA hair snags. Data collection is often expensive, and it is not obvious how to optimize the frequency of sampling and the spatial layout of detectors. Results from a pilot study may be extrapolated by simulation to predict the effectiveness of different configurations of multiple detectors, but simulation is slow and requires technical expertise. Another approach for evaluating novel designs is to compute intermediate variables such as the expected number of detected individuals E(n) and expected number of recapture events E(r), and to seek relationships between these variables and quantities of interest such as precision and power. We present formulae for the expected counts and power. For many scenarios the relative standard error (RSE) of estimated density is close to 1/min{E(n),E(r)}, and for maximum precision E(n) approximate to E(r). We compare the approximation for RSE(D<^>) with more rigorous results from simulation. Computation of E(n) and E(r) is deterministic and much faster than simulation, so it is readily included in interactive software for designing studies with enough power to answer ecological questions.

However, population genomics outlier approaches to detect selected loci may be inappropriate for clinal populations or those with unclear population structure because they require that individuals be clustered into populations. An alternate approach, landscape genomics, uses individual-based approaches to detect loci under selection and reveal potential environmental drivers of selection. We tested four landscape genomics methods on a simulated clinal population to determine their effectiveness at identifying a locus under varying selection strengths along an environmental gradient. We found all methods produced very low type I error rates across all selection strengths, but elevated type II error rates under weak selection. We then applied these methods to an AFLP genome scan of an alpine plant, Campanula barbata, and identified five highly supported candidate loci associated with precipitation variables. These loci also showed spatial autocorrelation and cline patterns indicative of selection along a precipitation gradient. Our results suggest that landscape genomics in combination with other spatial analyses provides a powerful approach for identifying loci potentially under selection and explaining spatially complex interactions between species and their environment.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  53     Total Times Cited:  54     Cited Reference Count:  83 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/evo.12237     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Campanula barbata;computer simulation;landscape genomics;natural selection;spatial statistics;ADAPTIVE GENETIC-VARIATION;POSITIVE SELECTION;DNA POLYMORPHISM;ECOLOGICAL DATA;CLIMATE-CHANGE;ADAPTATION;GRADIENTS;DOMINANT;CLASSIFICATION;DISTRIBUTIONS;Genomics;Genome,,

However, quantifying range expansion rates may be heavily influenced by methodology and/or sampling bias. We compared expansion rate estimates of Roesel's bush-cricket (Metrioptera roeselii, Hagenbach 1822), a nonnative species currently expanding its range in south-central Sweden, from range statistic models based on distance measures (mean, median, 95th gamma quantile, marginal mean, maximum, and conditional maximum) and an area-based method (grid occupancy). We used sampling simulations to determine the sensitivity of the different methods to incomplete sampling across the species' range. For periods when we had comprehensive survey data, range expansion estimates clustered into two groups: (1) those calculated from range margin statistics (gamma, marginal mean, maximum, and conditional maximum: similar to 3 km/year), and (2) those calculated from the central tendency (mean and median) and the area-based method of grid occupancy (similar to 1.5 km/year). Range statistic measures differed greatly in their sensitivity to sampling effort; the proportion of sampling required to achieve an estimate within 10% of the true value ranged from 0.17 to 0.9. Grid occupancy and median were most sensitive to sampling effort, and the maximum and gamma quantile the least. If periods with incomplete sampling were included in the range expansion calculations, this generally lowered the estimates (range 16-72%), with exception of the gamma quantile that was slightly higher (6%). Care should be taken when interpreting rate expansion estimates from data sampled from only a fraction of the full distribution. Methods based on the central tendency will give rates approximately half that of methods based on the range margin. The gamma quantile method appears to be the most robust to incomplete sampling bias and should be considered as the method of choice when sampling the entire distribution is not possible.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1002/ece3.1106     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biological invasion;citizen science;citizen-reported data;dispersal;distribution;insects;invasive species;Metrioptera roeseli;orthoptera;range shift;ROESELS BUSH-CRICKET;INDIVIDUAL MALE MOVEMENT;METRIOPTERA-ROESELI;CLIMATE-CHANGE;LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE;DISPERSAL;SPREAD;INVASION;IMPACTS;SHIFTS,,

The rates or probabilities for these processes can vary by time, by location, and by individual. These processes can co-vary and interact to varying degrees, e.g., an animal can only reproduce when it is in a particular maturation state. Population dynamics models that treat the processes as independent may yield somewhat biased or imprecise parameter estimates, as well as predictions of population abundances or densities. However, commonly used integral projection models (IPMs) typically assume independence across these demographic processes. We examine several approaches for modelling between process dependence in IPMs and include cases where the processes co-vary as a function of time (temporal variation), co-vary within each individual (individual heterogeneity), and combinations of these (temporal variation and individual heterogeneity). We compare our methods to conventional IPMs, which treat vital rates independent, using simulations and a case study of Soay sheep (Ovis aries). In particular, our results indicate that correlation between vital rates can moderately affect variability of some population-level statistics. Therefore, including such dependent structures is generally advisable when fitting IPMs to ascertain whether or not such between vital rate dependencies exist, which in turn can have subsequent impact on population management or life-history evolution.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  62 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: important part of paper?",10.1002/ece3.8682     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),copula models;correlated vital rates;generalized linear mixed models;population growth rate;reproduction investment;Soay sheep;LINEAR MIXED MODELS;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;INDIVIDUAL HETEROGENEITY;ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE;GROWTH;EVOLUTION;CONSTRUCTION;REPRODUCTION;TRAJECTORIES;SIMULATIONS,,

Ignoring sampling uncertainty might lead to biased estimation of the strength of density dependence. This is typically addressed using state-space model approaches, which integrate sampling error and population process estimates. Such models seldom include an explicit link between the sampling procedures and the true abundance, which is common in capture-recapture settings. However, many of the models proposed to estimate abundance in the presence of capture heterogeneity lead to incomplete likelihood functions and cannot be straightforwardly included in state-space models. We assessed the importance of estimating sampling error explicitly by taking an intermediate approach between ignoring uncertainty in abundance estimates and fully specified state-space models for density-dependence estimation based on autoregressive processes. First, we estimated individual capture probabilities based on a heterogeneity model for a closed population, using a conditional multinomial likelihood, followed by a Horvitz-Thompson estimate for abundance. Second, we estimated coefficients of autoregressive models for the log abundance. Inference was performed using the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). We performed an extensive simulation study to compare our approach with estimates disregarding capture history information, and using R-package VGAM, for different parameter specifications. The methods were then applied to a real data set of gray-sided volesMyodes rufocanusfrom Northern Norway. We found that density-dependence estimation was improved when explicitly modeling sampling error in scenarios with low process variances, in which differences in coverage reached up to 8% in estimating the coefficients of the autoregressive processes. In this case, the bias also increased assuming a Poisson distribution in the observational model. For high process variances, the differences between methods were small and it appeared less important to model heterogeneity.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1002/ece3.6642,abundance;capture probability;closed population models;density dependence;INLA;process variance;ESTIMATING DENSITY-DEPENDENCE;TIME-SERIES;MODELS;CYCLES;FLUCTUATIONS;COMPLEXITY;INFERENCE;SURVIVAL;VOLES;BIAS;Animal Shells;Animals,,

Recent research has shown that errors at adjacent sites often occur during DNA replication, and the resulting multinucleotide mutations (MNMs) are overwhelmingly likely to be non-synonymous. To evaluate whether the BST misinterprets sequence patterns produced by MNMs as false support for positive selection, we analysed two genomescale datasetsone from mammals and one from flies. We found that codons with multiple differences account for virtually all the support for lineage-specific positive selection in the BST. Simulations under conditions derived from these alignments but without positive selection show that realistic rates of MNMs cause a strong and systematic bias towards false inferences of selection. This bias is sufficient under empirically derived conditions to produce false positive inferences as often as the BST infers positive selection from the empirical data. Although some genes with BST-positive results may have evolved adaptively, the test cannot distinguish sequence patterns produced by authentic positive selection from those caused by neutral fixation of MNMs. Many published inferences of adaptive evolution using this technique may therefore be artefacts of model violation caused by unincorporated neutral mutational processes.

Bayesian latent class analysis (BLCA) modeling offers a potential solution, providing estimates of prevalence levels and diagnostic test accuracy under the realistic assumption that no diagnostic test is perfect. In typical applications of this approach, the specificity of one test is fixed at or close to 100%, allowing the model to simultaneously estimate the sensitivity and specificity of all other tests, in addition to infection prevalence. In wildlife systems, a test with near-perfect specificity is not always available, so we simulated data to investigate how decreasing this fixed specificity value affects the accuracy of model estimates. We used simulations to explore how the trade-off between diagnostic test specificity and sensitivity impacts prevalence estimates and found that directional biases depend on pathogen prevalence. Both the precision and accuracy of results depend on the sample size, the diagnostic tests used, and the true infection prevalence, so these factors should be considered when applying BLCA to estimate disease prevalence and diagnostic test accuracy in wildlife systems. A wildlife disease case study, focusing on leptospirosis in California sea lions, demonstrated the potential for Bayesian latent class methods to provide reliable estimates under real-world conditions. We delineate conditions under which BLCA improves upon the results from a single diagnostic across a range of prevalence levels and sample sizes, demonstrating when this method is preferable for disease ecologists working in a wide variety of pathogen systems.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  41 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1002/ece3.6448,Bayesian latent class;California sea lion;diagnostic test;disease;infection;prevalence;sensitivity;specificity;IDENTIFYING RESERVOIRS;LEPTOSPIRA-INTERROGANS;DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY;CLASS MODELS;GOLD;VALIDATION;INFECTION;ELISA;PCR;Bias (Epidemiology),,

One desirable property of a phylogenetic estimator is that of statistical consistency, which means intuitively that as more data are collected, the probability that the estimated tree has the same topology as the true tree goes to 1. To date, consistency results for species tree inference under the multispecies coalescent (MSC) have been derived only for summary statistics methods, such as ASTRAL and MP-EST. These methods have been found to be consistent given true gene trees but may be inconsistent when gene trees are estimated from data for loci of finite length. Here, we consider the question of statistical consistency for four taxa for SVDQuartets for general data types, as well as for the maximum likelihood (ML) method in the case in which the data are a collection of sites generated under the MSC model such that the sites are conditionally independent given the species tree (we call these data coalescent independent sites [CIS] data). We show that SVDQuartets is statistically consistent for all data types (i.e., for both CIS data and formultilocus data), and we derive its rate of convergence. We additionally show that ML is consistent for CIS data under the JC69 model and discuss why a proof for the more general multilocus case is difficult. Finally, we compare the performance of ML and SDVQuartets using simulation for both data types.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1093/sysbio/syaa039     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Consistency;gene tree;maximum likelihood;multilocus data;hylogenetic inference;species tree;SVDQuartets;SEQUENCE DATA;MOLECULAR EVOLUTION;IDENTIFIABILITY;MODEL;Trees,,

The last few years have seen increasingly sophisticated models employed in the evaluation of more and more detailed evolutionary hypotheses, including adaptive hypotheses with multiple selective optima and hypotheses with rate variation within and across lineages. The statistical performance of these sophisticated models has received relatively little systematic attention, however. We conducted an extensive simulation study to quantify the statistical properties of a class of models toward the simpler end of the spectrum that model phenotypic evolution using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We focused on identifying where, how, and why these methods break down so that users can apply them with greater understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. Our analysis identifies three key determinants of performance: a discriminability ratio, a signal-to-noise ratio, and the number of taxa sampled. Interestingly, we find that model-selection power can be high even in regions that were previously thought to be difficult, such as when tree size is small. On the other hand, we find that model parameters are in many circumstances difficult to estimate accurately, indicating a relative paucity of information in the data relative to these parameters. Nevertheless, we note that accurate model selection is often possible when parameters are only weakly identified. Our results have implications for more sophisticated methods inasmuch as the latter are generalizations of the case we study.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  59     Total Times Cited:  59     Cited Reference Count:  51 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1093/sysbio/syv043     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Adaptation;evolutionary model;model selection;Ornstein-Uhlenbeck;phylogenetic comparative analysis;STABILIZING SELECTION;PATTERNS;DIVERSIFICATION;ADAPTATION;RADIATION;SHIFTS,,

Although existing algorithms, such as Lasso, empirical Bayesian Lasso (EBlasso) and elastic net (EN) are available to infer such QTL models, more powerful methods are highly desirable to detect more QTLs in the presence of correlated QTLs. We developed a novel empirical Bayesian EN (EBEN) algorithm for multiple QTL mapping that inherits the efficiency of our previously developed EBlasso algorithm. Simulation results demonstrated that EBEN provided higher power of detection and almost the same false discovery rate compared with EN and EBlasso. Particularly, EBEN can identify correlated QTLs that the other two algorithms may fail to identify. When analyzing a real dataset, EBEN detected more effects than EN and EBlasso. EBEN provides a useful tool for inferring high-dimensional sparse model in multiple QTL mapping and other applications.

Accounting for linkage disequilibrium in genome scans increases detection power, but haplotype-based methods require individual genotypes and are not applicable on pool-sequenced samples. We propose to take advantage of the local score approach to account for linkage disequilibrium in genome scans for selection, cumulating (possibly small) signals from single markers over a genomic segment, to clearly pinpoint a selection signal. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate that this approach detects selection with higher power than several state-of-the-art single-marker, windowing or haplotype-based approaches. We illustrate this on two benchmark data sets including individual genotypes, for which we obtain similar results with the local score and one haplotype-based approach. Finally, we apply the local score approach to Pool-Seq data obtained from a divergent selection experiment on behaviour in quail and obtain precise and biologically coherent selection signals: while competing methods fail to highlight any clear selection signature, our method detects several regions involving genes known to act on social responsiveness or autistic traits. Although we focus here on the detection of positive selection from multiple population data, the local score approach is general and can be applied to other genome scans for selection or other genomewide analyses such as GWAS.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  33     Total Times Cited:  33     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/mec.14141     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),local score;NGS;pool sequencing;quail;selection signatures;SOCIAL REINSTATEMENT BEHAVIOR;RECENT POSITIVE SELECTION;JAPANESE-QUAIL;POPULATION DIFFERENTIATION;STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE;DIVERGENT SELECTION;WIDE ASSOCIATION;SWEEPS;SPECTRUM;MAP;Linkage Disequilibrium;Genotype;Genome;Genomics,,

Incongruence in delimitation schemes is a potential by-product of employing multiple methods on the same data, and little attention has been paid to its reconciliation. Instead, a particular scheme is prioritized, and/or molecular delimitations are coupled with additional, independent lines of evidence that mitigate incongruence. We advocate that incongruence within a line of evidence should be accounted for before comparing across lines of evidence that can themselves be incongruent. Additionally, it is not uncommon for empiricists working in nonmodel systems to be data-limited, generating some concern for the adequacy of available data to address the question of interest. With conservation and management decisions often hinging on the status of species, it seems prudent to understand the capabilities of approaches we use given the data we have. Here, we apply two molecular species delimitation approaches, spedeSTEM and BPP, to the Castilleja ambigua (Orobanchaceae) species complex, a relatively young plant lineage in western North America. Upon finding incongruence in our delimitation, we employed a post hoc simulation study to examine the power of these approaches to delimit species. Given the data we collected, we find that spedeSTEM lacks the power to delimit while BPP is capable, thus allowing us to address incongruence before proceeding in delimitation. We suggest post hoc simulation studies like this compliment empirical delimitation and serve as a means of exploring conflict within a line of evidence and dealing with it appropriately.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  92 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not evaluating a stats model,simulation was used for a sensitivity analysis",10.1111/mec.14590     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),BPP;Castilleja;incongruent delimitation scheme;simulation;species delimitation;spedeSTEM;PHYLOGENETIC UTILITY;INTEGRATIVE TAXONOMY;CHROMOSOME-NUMBERS;CASTILLEJA;MULTILOCUS;DNA;OROBANCHACEAE;POLYPLOIDY;MODEL;SCROPHULARIACEAE,,

Random Forest allows conducting inferences at a low computational cost, without preliminary selection of the relevant components of the ABC summary statistics, and bypassing the derivation of ABC tolerance levels. We have implemented a set of RF algorithms to process inferences using simulated data sets generated from an extended version of the population genetic simulator implemented in DIYABC v2.1.0. The resulting computer package, named DIYABC Random Forest v1.0, integrates two functionalities into a user-friendly interface: the simulation under custom evolutionary scenarios of different types of molecular data (microsatellites, DNA sequences or SNPs) and RF treatments including statistical tools to evaluate the power and accuracy of inferences. We illustrate the functionalities of DIYABC Random Forest v1.0 for both scenario choice and parameter estimation through the analysis of pseudo-observed and real data sets corresponding to pool-sequencing and individual-sequencing SNP data sets. Because of the properties inherent to the implemented RF methods and the large feature vector (including various summary statistics and their linear combinations) available for SNP data, DIYABC Random Forest v1.0 can efficiently contribute to the analysis of large SNP data sets to make inferences about complex population genetic histories.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  19     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  44 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: simulation used for prior distribution",10.1111/1755-0998.13413,"approximate Bayesian computation;demographic history;model or scenario selection;parameter estimation;pool&#8208;sequencing;population genetics;random forest;SNP;supervised machine learning;MODEL CHOICE;ABC;Polymorphism, Genetic",,

Many studies use the program structure combined with the Delta K method to identify the most probable number of populations (K).

We suggested two reasons for this: hierarchical population structure leads to underestimation, or the Delta K method does not evaluate K = 1 causing an overestimation. The present contribution aims to develop a better understanding of the limits of the method using one, two and three population simulations across migration scenarios. From these simulations we identified the ""best K"" using model likelihood and Delta K. Our findings show that mean probability plots and Delta K are unable to resolve the correct number of populations once migration rate exceeds 0.005. We also found a strong bias towards selecting K = 2 using the Delta K method. We used these data to identify the range of values where the Delta K statistic identifies a value of K that is not well supported. Finally, using the simulations and a review of empirical data, we found that the magnitude of Delta K corresponds to the level of divergence between populations. Based on our findings, we suggest researchers should use the Delta K method cautiously; they need to report all relevant data, including the magnitude of Delta K, and an estimate of connectivity for the research community to assess whether meaningful genetic structure exists within the context of management and conservation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  40     Total Times Cited:  40     Cited Reference Count:  35 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Maybe""}",10.1111/mec.15374     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),F-ST;genetic structure;migration rate;population structure;Delta K;POPULATION-STRUCTURE;COMPUTER-PROGRAM;R-PACKAGE;INFERENCE;DIFFERENTIATION;IDENTIFICATION;PERFORMANCE;ASSIGNMENT;CLUSTERS;SOFTWARE,,

In phyllostomid bats for example, is mandible morphology associated to diet preferences? Performing such analyses depends upon reliable phylogenetic regression techniques and associated tests (e.g., phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares, pGLS, and phylogenetic analyses of variance and covariance, pANOVA, pANCOVA). While these tools are well established for univariate data, their multivariate counterparts are lagging behind. This is particularly true for high-dimensional phenotypic data, such as morphometric data. Here, we implement much-needed likelihood-based multivariate pGLS, pMANOVA, and pMANCOVA, and use a recently developed penalized-likelihood framework to extend their application to the difficult case when the number of traits p approaches or exceeds the number of species n. We then focus on the pMANOVA and use intensive simulations to assess the performance of the approach as p increases, under various levels of phylogenetic signal and correlations between the traits, phylogenetic structure in the predictors, and under various types of phenotypic differences across species groups. We show that our approach outperforms available alternatives under all circumstances, with greater power to detect phenotypic differences across species group when they exist, and a lower risk of improperly detecting nonexistent differences. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration of our pMANOVA on a geometric-morphometric data set describing mandible morphology in phyllostomid bats along with data on their diet preferences. Overall our results show significant differences between ecological groups. Our approach, implemented in the R package mvMORPH and illustrated in a tutorial for end-users, provides efficient multivariate phylogenetic regression tools for understanding what shapes phenotypic differences across species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  20     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  100 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1093/sysbio/syaa010     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Generalized least squares;high-dimensional data sets;multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods;penalized likelihood;phenomics;phyllostomid bats;phylogenetic MANOVA;phylogenetic regression;R PACKAGE;CROSS-VALIDATION;PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS;REGULARIZED MANOVA;COVARIANCE;LIKELIHOOD;MODELS;EVOLUTION;CLASSIFICATION;INFORMATION;Mandible,,

The widespread availability of genome data, along with novel statistical techniques, has made it easier to detect these changes. We apply one such method, the ""Singleton Density Score"" (SOS), to the Holstein breed of Bos taurus to detect recent selection (arising up to around 740 years ago). We identify several genes as candidates for targets of recent selection, including some relating to cell regulation, catabolic processes, neural-cell adhesion and immunity. We do not find strong evidence that three traits that are important to humans-milk protein content, milk fat content, and stature- have been subject to directional selection. Simulations demonstrate that because B. taurus recently experienced a population bottleneck, singletons are depleted so the power of SDS methods is reduced. These results inform on which genes underlie recent genetic change in B. taurus, while providing information on how polygenic selection can be best investigated in future studies.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  100 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/ev13.263,Bos taurus;genomics;milk fat;milk protein;selection;stature;STABILIZING SELECTION;POLYGENIC ADAPTATION;GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION;POSITIVE SELECTION;COMPLEX TRAITS;CATTLE;SIGNATURES;SWEEPS;LOCI;HEIGHT;Cattle,,

Here, we developed a simulation framework to perform spatially explicit statistical power analysis of biological monitoring programs for detecting temporal trends in occupancy for multiple species. Using raster layers representing the spatial variation in current occupancy and species-level detectability for one or multiple observation methods, our framework simulates changes in occupancy over space and time, with the capacity to explicitly model stochastic disturbances at monitoring sites (i.e., dynamic landscapes). Once users specify the number and location of sites, the frequency and duration of surveys, and the type of detection method(s) for each species, our framework estimates power to detect occupancy trends, both across the landscape and/or within nested management units. As a case study, we evaluated the power of a long-term monitoring program to detect trends in occupancy for 136 species (83 birds, 33 reptiles, and 20 mammals) across and within Kakadu, Litchfield, and Nitmiluk National Parks in northern Australia. We assumed continuation of an original monitoring design implemented since 1996, with the addition of camera trapping. As expected, power to detect trends was sensitive to the direction and magnitude of the change in occupancy, detectability, initial occupancy levels, and the rarity of species. Our simulations suggest that monitoring has at least an 80% chance at detecting a 50% decline in occupancy for 22% of the modeled species across the three parks over the next 15 yr. Monitoring is more likely to detect increasing occupancy trends, with at least an 80% chance at detecting a 50% increase in 87% of species. The addition of camera-trapping increased average power to detect a 50% decline in mammals compared with using only live trapping by 63%. We provide a flexible tool that can help decision-makers design and evaluate monitoring programs for hundreds of species at a time in a range of ecological settings, while explicitly considering the distribution of species and alternative sampling methods.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  45 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Maybe""}",10.1002/eap.1950,Kakadu;occupancy;optimal monitoring;population declines;simulation;spatially explicit power analysis;species distribution modeling;statistical power;KAKADU-NATIONAL-PARK;STATISTICAL POWER;IMPERFECT DETECTION;CONSERVATION;DESIGN;MAMMALS;BIRDS,,

However, previous studies of habitat heterogeneity and local adaptation have largely been limited to simple landscapes, which poorly represent the multiscale habitat structure common in nature. Here, we use simulations to pursue two goals: (i) we explore how landscape heterogeneity, dispersal ability and selection affect the strength of local adaptation, and (ii) we evaluate the performance of several genotype-environment association (GEA) methods for detecting loci involved in local adaptation. We found that the strength of local adaptation increased in spatially aggregated selection regimes, but remained strong in patchy landscapes when selection was moderate to strong. Weak selection resulted in weak local adaptation that was relatively unaffected by landscape heterogeneity. In general, the power of detection methods closely reflected levels of local adaptation. False-positive rates (FPRs), however, showed distinct differences across GEA methods based on levels of population structure. The univariate GEA approach had high FPRs (up to 55%) under limited dispersal scenarios, due to strong isolation by distance. By contrast, multivariate, ordination-based methods had uniformly low FPRs (0-2%), suggesting these approaches can effectively control for population structure. Specifically, constrained ordinations had the best balance of high detection and low FPRs and will be a useful addition to the GEA toolkit. Our results provide both theoretical and practical insights into the conditions that shape local adaptation and how these conditions impact our ability to detect selection.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  138     Total Times Cited:  141     Cited Reference Count:  87 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/mec.13476     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CDPOP;complex landscapes;genome scans;latent factor mixed model;natural selection;ordination methods;POPULATION-GENETICS;MANTEL TEST;SELECTION;FLOW;POLYMORPHISM;GENOMICS;ENVIRONMENTS;MUTATIONS;EVOLUTION;MODELS,,

The goal of these models is to account for rate variation among lineages, such that they are assumed to be adequate descriptions of the processes that generated the data. A common approach for selecting a clock model for a data set of interest is to examine a set of candidates and to select the model that provides the best statistical fit. However, this can lead to unreliable estimates if all the candidate models are actually inadequate. For this reason, a method of evaluating absolute model performance is critical. We describe a method that uses posterior predictive simulations to assess the adequacy of clock models. We test the power of this approach using simulated data and find that the method is sensitive to bias in the estimates of branch lengths, which tends to occur when using underparameterized clock models. We also compare the performance of the multinomial test statistic, originally developed to assess the adequacy of substitution models, but find that it has low power in identifying the adequacy of clock models. We illustrate the performance of our method using empirical data sets from coronaviruses, simian immunodeficiency virus, killer whales, and marine turtles. Our results indicate that methods of investigating model adequacy, including the one proposed here, should be routinely used in combination with traditional model selection in evolutionary studies. This will reveal whether a broader range of clock models to be considered in phylogenetic analysis.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  25     Total Times Cited:  25     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1093/molbev/msv154     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),model adequacy;posterior predictive simulations;Bayesian phylogenetics;molecular clock;evolutionary rates;model selection;PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS;SUBSTITUTION;EVOLUTION;INFERENCE;CALIBRATION;CHOICE;UNCERTAINTY;FREQUENTIST;COALESCENT;SELECTION,,

RADseq was initially designed for studying genetic variation across genomes at the population level, but has also proved to be suitable for interspecific phylogeny reconstruction. RADseq data pose challenges for standard phylogenomic methods, however, due to incomplete coverage of the genome and large amounts of missing data. Alignment-free methods are both efficient and accurate for phylogenetic reconstructions with whole genomes and are especially practical for nonmodel organisms; nonetheless, alignment-free methods have not been applied with reduced genome sequencing data. Here, we test a full-genome assembly- and alignment-free method, AAF, in application to RADseq data and propose two procedures for reads selection to remove reads from restriction sites that were not found in taxa being compared. We validate these methods using both simulations and real data sets. Reads selection improved the accuracy of phylogenetic construction in every simulated scenario and the two real data sets, making AAF as good or better than a comparable alignment-based method, even though AAF had much lower computational burdens. We also investigated the sources of missing data in RADseq and their effects on phylogeny reconstruction using AAF.

We illustrate how missing discrete data affect disparity using a novel simulation for removing data based on parameters from published datasets that contain both extinct and extant taxa. We develop an algorithm that assesses the distribution of missing characters in extinct taxa, and simulates data loss by applying that distribution to extant taxa. We term this technique linkage. We compare differences in disparity metrics and ordination spaces produced by linkage and random character removal. When we incorporated linkage among characters, disparity metrics declined and ordination spaces shrank at a slower rate with increasing missing data, indicating that correlations among characters govern the sensitivity of disparity analysis. We also present and test a new disparity method that uses the linkage algorithm to correct for the bias caused by missing data. We equalized proportions of missing data among time bins before calculating disparity, and found that estimates of disparity changed when missing data were taken into account. By removing the bias of missing data, we can gain new insights into the morphological evolution of organisms and highlight the detrimental effects of missing data on disparity analysis.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Maybe""}",10.1111/evo.12435     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Diversity;morphology;simulation;taphonomy;MORPHOLOGICAL DISPARITY;TELEOST FISHES;FOSSIL RECORD;EVOLUTION;DIVERSIFICATION;DIVERSITY;RADIATION;PATTERNS;SUPPORT;CLADES,,

Here we report a unique comparison of minimum detectable differences (MDDs) in SOC, and the estimated times required to observe those MDDs across the north central United States, calculated for the two most common SOC experiments: (1) a comparison between two treatments, e.g., moldboard plow (MP) and no-tillage (NT), using a randomized complete block design experiment; and (2) a comparison of changes in SOC over time for a particular treatment, e.g., NT, using a randomized complete block design experiment with time as an additional factor. We estimated the duration of the two experiment types required to achieve MDD through simulation of SOC dynamics. Data for the study came from 13 experimental sites located in Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Missouri, and Minnesota. Soil organic carbon, bulk density, and texture were measured at four soil depths. Minimum detectable differences were calculated with probability of Type I error of 0.05 and probability of Type II error of 0.15. The MDDs in SOC were highly variable across the region and increased with soil depth. At 0 to 10 cm (0 to 3.9 in) soil depth, MDDs with five replications ranged from 1.04 g C kg(-1) (0.017 oz C lb(-1); 6%) to 7.15 g C kg(-1) (0.114 oz C lb(-1); 31%) for comparison of two treatments; and from 0.46 g C kg(-1) (0.007 oz C lb(-1); 3%) to 3.12 g C kg(-1) (0.050 oz C lb(-1); 13%) for SOC change over time. Large differences were also predicted in the experiment duration required to detect a difference in SOC between MP and NT (from 8 to > 100 years with five replications), or a change in SOC over time under NT management (from 11 to 71 years with five replications). At most locations, the time required to detect a change in SOC under NT was shorter than the time required to detect a difference between MP and NT. Minimum detectable difference and experiment duration decreased with the number of replications and were correlated with SOC variability and soil texture of the experimental sites, i.e., they tended to be lower in fine textured soils. Experiment duration was also reduced by increased crop productivity and the amount of residue left on the soil. The relationships and methods described here enable the design of experiments with high power of detecting differences and changes in SOC and enhance our understanding of how management practices influence SOC storage.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  41     Total Times Cited:  41     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.2489/jswc.69.6.517     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),experiment duration;minimum detectable difference;no-till;soil organic carbon;statistical power;tillage;ORGANIC-CARBON;NO-TILLAGE;GRANTSBURG SOILS;SEQUESTRATION;DAYCENT;LONG;MANAGEMENT;IMPACTS;MATTER;CORN;United States,,

I tested whether a variety of hypothetical but logistically plausible survey designs could provide statistically powerful assessments of hypothetical but empirically based population responses to megafire.        Location Simulation focused on fire-prone forests.        Methods I varied the number of affected sites, detection probability, baseline occupancy and species' responses to fire to create 72 monitoring scenarios. I then simulated 10 years of site occupancy data in which a megafire or other disturbance occurred between years 5 and 6 (n = 500 iterations).        Results Statistical power to correctly reject the null hypothesis of no population response to megafire was high (mean across all scenarios = 0.78), but power to identify the correct population response (e.g. post-fire occupancy declined and then recovered) was low (mean = 0.29). Statistical power to not underestimate the effect of a megafire on site occupancy was fairly high (mean = 0.66), but power to accurately estimate site occupancy was low (mean = 0.25). Statistical power increased with the number of affected sites (i.e., sample size) and with the intensity of the focal species' response to megafire. Case study simulations based on an existing acoustic monitoring programme in the Sierra Nevada, USA, indicate that it is likely to identify Spotted Owl and Black-backed Woodpecker population responses to megafires. Researchers can use the included simulation tutorial to implement their own power analyses.        Main conclusions Landscape-scale monitoring programmes can identify population changes following megafires, but cannot reliably produce nuanced results, especially with only five years of post-fire data. Smaller-bodied species, which could be studied at more sites, are likely to be better focal species for megafire BACI studies.

Restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) methods are becoming increasingly popular for SNP data collection, but an assessment of the best practises for using these data in phylogenetics is lacking. We use computer simulations, and new double digest RADseq (ddRADseq) data for the lizard family Phrynosomatidae, to investigate the accuracy of RAD loci for phylogenetic inference. We compare the two primary ways RAD loci are used during phylogenetic analysis, including the analysis of full sequences (i.e., SNPs together with invariant sites), or the analysis of SNPs on their own after excluding invariant sites. We find that using full sequences rather than just SNPs is preferable from the perspectives of branch length and topological accuracy, but not of computational time. We introduce two new acquisition bias corrections for dealing with alignments composed exclusively of SNPs, a conditional likelihood method and a reconstituted DNA approach. The conditional likelihood method conditions on the presence of variable characters only (the number of invariant sites that are unsampled but known to exist is not considered), while the reconstituted DNA approach requires the user to specify the exact number of unsampled invariant sites prior to the analysis. Under simulation, branch length biases increase with the amount of missing data for both acquisition bias correction methods, but branch length accuracy is much improved in the reconstituted DNA approach compared to the conditional likelihood approach. Phylogenetic analyses of the empirical data using concatenation or a coalescent-based species tree approach provide strong support for many of the accepted relationships among phrynosomatid lizards, suggesting that RAD loci contain useful phylogenetic signal across a range of divergence times despite the presence of missing data. Phylogenetic analysis of RAD loci requires careful attention to model assumptions, especially if downstream analyses depend on branch lengths.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  201     Total Times Cited:  201     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not evaluating a stats model,it is looking at ""acquisition bias"" not statistical bias",10.1093/sysbio/syv053     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Conditional likelihood;ddRADseq;maximum likelihood;Phrynosoma;Phrynosomatidae;reconstituted DNA;SVDquartets;MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD;DISCOVERY;RESOLUTION;DIVERSITY;INFERENCE;Bias (Epidemiology);Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",,

This has motivated the development of statistical methods for detecting shifts in the rate of lineage diversification across the branches of phylogenic trees. One of the most frequently used methods, MEDUSA, explores a set of diversification-rate models, where each model assigns branches of the phylogeny to a set of diversification-rate categories. Each model is first fit to the data, and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) is then used to identify the optimal diversification model. Surprisingly, the statistical behavior of this popular method is uncharacterized, which is a concern in light of: (1) the poor performance of the AIC as a means of choosing among models in other phylogenetic contexts; (2) the ad hoc algorithm used to visit diversification models, and; (3) errors that we reveal in the likelihood function used to fit diversification models to the phylogenetic data. Here, we perform an extensive simulation study demonstrating that MEDUSA (1) has a high false-discovery rate (on average, spurious diversification-rate shifts are identified approximate to 30% of the time), and (2) provides biased estimates of diversification-rate parameters. Understanding the statistical behavior of MEDUSA is critical both to empirical researchers-in order to clarify whether these methods can make reliable inferences from empirical datasets-and to theoretical biologists-in order to clarify the specific problems that need to be solved in order to develop more reliable approaches for detecting shifts in the rate of lineage diversification.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  27     Cited Reference Count:  37 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1093/sysbio/syw026     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Akaike information criterion;extinction;lineage-specific diversification rates;phylogenetic model selection;speciation;EXTINCTION RATES;PHYLOGENETIC INFERENCE;MOLECULAR PHYLOGENIES;SPECIATION;DEPENDENCE;RADIATIONS;DIVERSITY;EVOLUTION;MODELS,,

These drawbacks occur because trait evolution is driven by two key processes-hierarchical and hidden-which are not accommodated simultaneously by the available phylogenetic methods. The hierarchical process refers to the dependencies between anatomical body parts, while the hidden process refers to the evolution of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlying trait development. Herein, I demonstrate that these processes can be efficiently modeled using structured Markov models (SMM) equipped with hidden states, which resolves the majority of the problems associated with discrete traits. Integration of SMM with anatomy ontologies can adequately incorporate the hierarchical dependencies, while the use of the hidden states accommodates hidden evolution of GRNs and substitution rate heterogeneity. I assess the new models using simulations and theoretical synthesis. The new approach solves the long-standing ""tail color problem,"" in which the trait is scored for species with tails of different colors or no tails. It also presents a previously unknown issue called the ""two-scientist paradox,"" in which the nature of coding the trait and the hidden processes driving the trait's evolution are confounded; failing to account for the hidden process may result in a bias, which can be avoided by using hidden state models. All this provides a clear guideline for coding traits into characters. This article gives practical examples of using the new framework for phylogenetic inference and comparative analysis.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  23     Cited Reference Count:  81 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1093/sysbio/syz005     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Anatomy ontology;character;discrete trait;gene regulatory networks;hidden Markov models;homology;lumpability;morphology;structured Markov models;MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTER;CORRELATED EVOLUTION;REGULATORY NETWORKS;HOMOLOGY;PHYLOGENIES;PARSIMONY;HOMOPLASY;INSIGHTS;ORIGINS;TESTS;Phenotype,,

We use a POlymorphisms-aware phylogenetic MOdel (PoMo) that we have recently shown to efficiently estimate mutation rates and fixation biases from within and between-species variation data. We extend this model to perform efficient estimation of species trees. We test the performance of PoMo in several different scenarios of incomplete lineage sorting using simulations and compare it with existing methods both in accuracy and computational speed. In contrast to other approaches, our model does not use coalescent theory but is allele frequency based.

Using occurrence data from the Paleobiology Database, I identify genera that have a significant affinity for carbonate or terrigenous clastic depositional environments that transcends the Database's representation of these environments during the stratigraphic range of each genus. These affinity assignments are not a matter of arbitrarily subdividing a continuum in preference; rather, genera form distinct, nonrandom subsets with respect to environmental preference. I tabulate the stage-by-stage transitions in range size within individual genera and the stage-by-stage changes in the extent of each environment. Comparing the two shows that genera with a preference for a given environment are more likely to increase in geographic range, and to show a larger average increase in range, when that environment increases in areal extent, and likewise for decreases in geographic range and environmental area. Similar results obtain for genera with preferences for reefal and non-reef settings. Simulations and subsampling experiments suggest that these results are not artifacts of methodology or sampling bias. Nor are they confined to particular higher taxa. Genera with roughly equal preference for carbonates and clastics do not have substantially broader geographic ranges than those with a distinct affinity, suggesting that, at this scale of analysis, spatial extent of preferred environment outweighs breadth of environmental preference in governing geographic range. These results pertain to changes over actual geologic time within individual genera, not overall average ranges. Recent work has documented a regular expansion and contraction when absolute time is ignored and genera are superimposed to form a composite average. Environmental preference may contribute to this pattern, but its role appears to be minor, limited mainly to the initial expansion and final contraction of relatively short-lived genera.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  23     Cited Reference Count:  60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Maybe""}",10.1666/13056     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),LATITUDINAL DIVERSITY GRADIENT;ORDOVICIAN RADIATION;SPECIES-LEVEL;CRETACEOUS MOLLUSKS;NICHE CONSERVATISM;BIOTIC INVASION;OHIO REGION;EXTINCTION;DYNAMICS;BIVALVES;Animal Shells;Animals;Military Personnel,,

For plants, h2 estimates generally rely on maternal progeny designs, assuming that offspring are either half-sibs or unrelated. However, plant mating systems often depart from half-sib assumptions, this can bias h2 estimates. Here, we investigate how to accurately estimate h2 in nonmodel species through the analysis of sibling designs with a moderate genotyping effort. We performed simulations to investigate how microsatellite marker information available for only a subset of offspring can improve h2 estimates based on maternal progeny designs in the presence of nonrandom mating, inbreeding in the parental population or maternal effects. We compared the basic family method, considering or not adjustments based on average relatedness coefficients, and methods based on the animal model. The animal model was used with average relatedness information, or with hybrid relatedness information: associating one-generation pedigree and family assumptions, or associating one-generation pedigree and average relatedness coefficients. Our results highlighted that methods using marker-based relatedness coefficients performed as well as pedigree-based methods in the presence of nonrandom mating (i.e. unequal male reproductive contributions, selfing), offering promising prospects to investigate insitu heritabilities in natural populations. In the presence of maternal effects, only the use of pairwise relatednesses through pedigree information improved the accuracy of h2 estimates. In that case, the amount of father-related offspring in the sibling design is the most critical. Overall, we showed that the method using both one-generation pedigree and average relatedness coefficients was the most robust to various ecological scenarios.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Maybe""}",10.1111/1755-0998.12536     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"heritability;inbreeding;marker-based relatednesses;maternal effects;pedigree-free methods;unequal reproductive success;SPATIAL GENETIC-STRUCTURE;NATURAL-POPULATIONS;TREE POPULATIONS;PEDIGREE RECONSTRUCTION;QUANTITATIVE TRAITS;MOLECULAR MARKERS;MATING SYSTEM;ANIMAL-MODELS;RELATEDNESS;FLOW;Genotype;Polymorphism, Genetic",,

Within the maximum-likelihood paradigm, the best tree is a point estimate. To determine how strongly the data support such an evolutionary scenario, a hypothesis testing methodology is required. To this end, the Kishino-Hasegawa (KH) test was developed to determine whether one topology is significantly more supported by the sequence data than another one. This test and its derivatives are widely used in phylogenetics and phylogenomics. Here, we show that the KH test is biased in the presence of alignment error and can lead to erroneous conclusions. Using simulations we demonstrated that due to alignment errors the KH test often rejects one of the competing topologies, even though both topologies are equally supported by the data. Specifically, we show that the KH test favors the guide tree used to align the analyzed sequences. Further, branch length optimization renders the test too conservative. We propose two possible corrections for these biases. First, we evaluated the impact of removing unreliable alignment columns and found out that it decreases the bias at the cost of substantially reducing the test's power. Second, we developed a parametric test that entirely abolishes the biases without data filtering. This test incorporates the alignment construction step into the test's hypothesis, thus removing the above guide tree effect. We extend this methodology for the case of multiple-topology comparisons and demonstrate the applicability of the new methodology on an exemplary data set.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16     Total Times Cited:  16     Cited Reference Count:  31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1093/molbev/msu231     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),alignment;alignment uncertainty;KH test;SOWH test;phylogeny;likelihood;tree comparisons;branch length optimization;PHYLOGENETIC TREE SELECTION;MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD;SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT;POSITIVE SELECTION;CONFIDENCE;INFERENCE;PERFORMANCE;ORIGIN,,

Here, we employ mixture models to construct a set of five composite likelihood ratio test statistics, which we collectively term B statistics. These statistics are agnostic to window sizes and can operate on diverse forms of input data. Through simulations, we show that they exhibit comparable power to the best-performing current methods, and retain substantially high power regardless of window sizes. They also display considerable robustness to high mutation rates and uneven recombination landscapes, as well as an array of other common confounding scenarios. Moreover, we applied a specific version of the B statistics, termed B-2, to a human population-genomic data set and recovered many top candidates from prior studies, including the then-uncharacterized STPG2 and CCDC169-SOHLH2, both of which are related to gamete functions. We further applied B2 on a bonobo population-genomic data set. In addition to the MHC-DQ genes, we uncovered several novel candidate genes, such as KLRD1, involved in viral defense, and SCN9A, associated with pain perception.

One approach taken by methods such as K-A/K-S and the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test is to compare the frequency of non-synonymous and synonymous changes. These methods, however, rely on the assumption that a change in frequency of one mutation will not affect changes in frequency of other mutations.        Results: We demonstrate that linkage between sites can bias measures of selection based on synonymous and non-synonymous changes. Using forward simulation of a Wright-Fisher process, we show that hitch-hiking of deleterious mutations with advantageous mutations can lead to overestimation of the number of adaptive substitutions, while background selection and clonal interference can distort the site frequency spectrum to obscure the signal for positive selection. We present three diagnostics for detecting these effects of linked selection and apply them to the human influenza (H3N2) hemagglutinin gene.        Conclusion: Various forms of linked selection have characteristic effects on MK-type statistics. The extent of background selection, hitch-hiking and clonal interference can be evaluated using the diagnostic statistics presented here. The diagnostics can also be used to determine how well we expect the MK statistics to perform and whether one form of the statistic may be preferable to another.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Maybe""}",10.1186/1471-2148-13-244     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),K-A/K-S;McDonald-Kreitman;Linkage;Background selection;Hitch-hiking;Clonal interference;ADAPTIVE PROTEIN EVOLUTION;DELETERIOUS MUTATIONS;BACKGROUND SELECTION;BENEFICIAL MUTATIONS;POPULATION-GENETICS;CLONAL INTERFERENCE;POSITIVE SELECTION;GENEALOGIES;HITCHHIKING;MODELS,,

A consequence of parallelism and convergence, long-branch effects arise in phylogenetic inference when there is unequal molecular divergence among lineages, and they can positively mislead inference based on parsimony especially, but also inference based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Long-branch effects have been exhaustively examined by simulation studies that have compared the performance of different inference methods in specific model trees and branch length spaces.        Results: In this paper, by generalizing the phylogenetic signal and noise analysis to quartets with uneven subtending branches, we quantify the utility of molecular characters for resolution of quartet phylogenies via parsimony. Our quantification incorporates contributions toward the correct tree from either signal or homoplasy (i.e. ""the right result for either the right reason or the wrong reason""). We also characterize a highly conservative lower bound of utility that incorporates contributions to the correct tree only when they correspond to true, unobscured parsimony-informative sites (i.e. ""the right result for the right reason""). We apply the generalized signal and noise analysis to classic quartet phylogenies in which long-branch effects can arise due to unequal rates of evolution or an asymmetrical topology. Application of the analysis leads to identification of branch length conditions in which inference will be inconsistent and reveals insights regarding how to improve sampling of molecular loci and taxa in order to correctly resolve phylogenies in which long-branch effects are hypothesized to exist.        Conclusions: The generalized signal and noise analysis provides analytical prediction of utility of characters evolving at diverse rates of evolution to resolve quartet phylogenies with unequal branch lengths. The analysis can be applied to identifying characters evolving at appropriate rates to resolve phylogenies in which long-branch effects are hypothesized to occur.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14     Total Times Cited:  14     Cited Reference Count:  91 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Maybe""}",10.1186/s12862-015-0364-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Long-branch effects;Felsenstein zone;Signal;Noise;Phylogenetic Inference;SYNAPOMORPHY ANALYSIS RASA;3 GENOMIC COMPARTMENTS;MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD;PHYLOGENETIC METHODS;INVARIANT SITES;SEQUENCE DATA;SEED PLANTS;DATA SETS;ATTRACTION;PARSIMONY;Trees,,

Alternatively, sexing can be based upon morphometric analysis, which remains invaluable in remote field conditions such as Polar regions. Nevertheless, discriminatory power may be affected by methodological issues hampering comparison between/within studies, e.g. considering alternative analytical techniques or measurements taken by different researchers. We investigated the sexing potential of bill length, bill depth and body mass in adult Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae of known sex. We performed discriminant analysis on a large dataset of measurements (237 males; 264 females) taken from penguins marked between 1994 and 2001, at Edmonson Point (Ross Sea, Antarctica). In a second step, we accounted for measurements collected by different researchers through permuted discriminant analysis. We found moderate support for sex discrimination through bill measurements (77%). Considering body mass did not improve classification power substantially (78.2%), possibly because of confounding inter/intra-annual oscillations in body condition. Discriminant rate decreased when controlling the researcher effect (72.7% and 71.4%, respectively). Results were also confirmed by logistic (mixed) models. Simulations showed that reduction in sample size markedly increased uncertainty in classification power. Differences with previous studies achieving a slightly greater classification power for sexing Adelie penguins through morphometrics could be related to (i) our higher sample size and/or (ii) geographical, population-specific differences, e.g. lower degree of sexual dimorphism. Our work emphasises key-factors influencing performance of morphometric sexing in avian species, advocating population-specific validation with large sample size as well as the necessity to account for the researcher effect prior to apply morphometric sexing.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: simulation was used for a sensitivity analysis",10.1007/s00300-021-02893-6,Adelie penguin;Bill size;Body mass;Discriminant analysis;Morphometric sexing;Sexual dimorphism;DISCRIMINANT FUNCTION-ANALYSIS;SEXUAL SIZE DIMORPHISM;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;EDMONSON POINT;SEA-ICE;BIRDS;IDENTIFICATION;ANTARCTICA;PARAMETERS;SEABIRDS,,

Because estimates of population size and demographic parameters usually include errors due to imperfect detection, estimations of the strength of density dependence will be biased if obtained with conventional methods and lack statistical power to detect density dependence. We propose a Bayesian integrated population model to study density dependence. The model allows assessing the effect of density both on the population growth rate as well as the demographic parameters while accounting for imperfect detection. We studied the performance of this model using simulation and illustrate its use with data on red-backed shrikes Lanius collurio. Our simulation results showed that the strength of density dependence is identifiable and it was estimated with higher precision using the integrated population model than the conventional regression model. As expected, the conventional regression model tended to overestimate density dependence at the population level whereas underestimates at the demographic level, but the bias was small. The analysis of the red-backed shrike data revealed negative density dependence at the population level most likely mediated by a density-dependent decline in adult survival. This work highlights the potential of integrated population models in assessing density dependence and its practical application in population studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Classic methods for detecting selection, such as the integrated haplotype score (iHS) and Fay and Wu's H statistic, are useful for candidate gene searching underlying positive selection. These methods, however, have limited capability to localize causal variants in selection target regions. In this study, we developed a novel method based on conditional coalescent tree to detect recent positive selection by counting unbalanced mutations on coalescent gene genealogies. Extensive simulation studies revealed that our method is more robust than many other approaches against biases due to various demographic effects, including population bottleneck, expansion, or stratification, while not sacrificing its power. Furthermore, our method demonstrated its superiority in localizing causal variants from massive linked genetic variants. The rate of successful localization was about 20-40% higher than that of other state-of-the-art methods on simulated data sets. On empirical data, validated functional causal variants of four well-known positive selected genes were all successfully localized by our method, such as ADH1B, MCM6, APOL1, and HBB. Finally, the computational efficiency of this new method was much higher than that of iHS implementations, that is, 24-66 times faster than the REHH package, and more than 10,000 times faster than the original iHS implementation. These magnitudes make our method suitable for applying on large sequencing data sets.

Importantly, the sensitivity of phylogenetic signal indices and their associated statistical tests to incompletely resolved phylogenies and suboptimal branch-length information has been only partially investigated.        Methods: Here, we use simulations of trait evolution along phylogenetic trees to assess whether incompletely resolved phylogenies (polytomic chronograms) and phylogenies with suboptimal branch-length information (pseudochronograms) could produce directional biases in significance tests ( p-values) associated with Blomberg et al.'s K and Pagel's lambda (lambda) statistics, two of the most widely used indices to measure and test phylogenetic signal. Specifically, we conducted pairwise comparisons between the p-values resulted from the use of ""true"" chronograms and their degraded counterparts (i. e. polytomic chronograms and pseudo-chronograms), and computed the frequency with which the null hypothesis of no phylogenetic signal was accepted using ""true"" chronograms but rejected when using their degraded counterparts ( type I bias) and vice versa ( type II bias).        Results: We found that the use of polytomic chronograms in combination with Blomberg et al.'s K resulted in both, clearly inflated estimates of phylogenetic signal and moderate levels of type I and II biases. More importantly, pseudo-chronograms led to high rates of type I biases. In contrast, Pagel's. was strongly robust to either incompletely resolved phylogenies and suboptimal branch-length information.        Conclusions: Our results suggest that pseudo-chronograms can lead to strong overestimation of phylogenetic signal when using Blomberg et al.'s K ( i. e. high rates of type I biases), while polytomies may be a minor concern given other sources of uncertainty. In contrast, Pagel's lambda seems strongly robust to either incompletely resolved phylogenies and suboptimal branch-length information. Hence, Pagel's lambda may be a more appropriate alternative over Blomberg et al.'s K to measure and test phylogenetic signal in most ecologically relevant traits when phylogenetic information is incomplete.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  76     Total Times Cited:  76     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s12862-017-0898-y     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),BLADJ;Blomberg's K;Pagel's lambda;Phylogeny calibration;Phylogenetic resolution;Pseudo-chronograms;COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;DIVERSITY;PATTERNS;MACROECOLOGY;ANGIOSPERMS;EVOLUTION;DYNAMICS;TRAITS;MODELS;PLANTS,,

Due to the characteristics of ecosystems and typical models thereof, such as non-linearity, high dimensionality, and low quantity and quality of observed data, this optimization task can be very hard for traditional (derivative-based or local) optimization methods. This calls for the use of advanced meta-heuristic approaches, such as evolutionary or swarm-based methods.        In this paper, we conduct an empirical comparison of four meta-heuristic optimization methods, and one local optimization method as a baseline, on a representative task of parameter estimation in a nonlinear dynamic model of an aquatic ecosystem. The five methods compared are the differential ant-stigmergy algorithm (DASA) and its continuous variant (CDASA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE) and algorithm 717 (A717). We use synthetic data, both without and with different levels of noise, as well as real measurements from Lake Bled. We also consider two different simulation approaches: teacher forcing, which makes supervised predictions one (small) time step ahead, and full (multistep) simulation, which makes predictions based on the history predictions for longer time periods.        The meta-heuristic global optimization methods for parameter estimation are clearly superior and should be preferred over local optimization methods. While the differences in performance between the different methods within the class of meta-heuristics are not significant across all conditions, differential evolution yields the best results in terms of quality of the reconstructed system dynamics as well as speed of convergence. While the use of teacher forcing simulation makes parameter estimation much faster, the use of full simulation produces much better parameter estimates from real measured data. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, with the rapidly growing amount of data, this task remains a computational bottleneck. Recently, approximation methods such as the RAxML rapid bootstrap (RBS) and the Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test have been introduced to speed up the bootstrap. Here, we suggest an ultrafast bootstrap approximation approach (UFBoot) to compute the support of phylogenetic groups in maximum likelihood (ML) based trees. To achieve this, we combine the resampling estimated log-likelihood method with a simple but effective collection scheme of candidate trees. We also propose a stopping rule that assesses the convergence of branch support values to automatically determine when to stop collecting candidate trees. UFBoot achieves a median speed up of 3.1 (range: 0.66-33.3) to 10.2 (range: 1.32-41.4) compared with RAxML RBS for real DNA and amino acid alignments, respectively. Moreover, our extensive simulations show that UFBoot is robust against moderate model violations and the support values obtained appear to be relatively unbiased compared with the conservative standard bootstrap. This provides a more direct interpretation of the bootstrap support. We offer an efficient and easy-to-use software (available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree) to perform the UFBoot analysis with ML tree inference.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1844     Total Times Cited:  1884     Cited Reference Count:  51 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1093/molbev/mst024     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),phylogenetic inference;nonparametric bootstrap;tree reconstruction;maximum likelihood;DNA-SEQUENCES;TREE-SPACE;MODEL;EVOLUTION;INFERENCE;PROTEIN;PERFORMANCE;SATURATION;CONFIDENCE;ALGORITHM,,

The development of statistical methods for detecting the signatures of historical introgression in whole-genome data has been a major area of focus. Although existing techniques are able to identify the taxa that exchanged genes during introgression using a four-taxon system, most methods do not explicitly distinguish which taxon served as donor and which as recipient during introgression (i.e., polarization of introgression directionality). Existing methods that do polarize introgression are often only able to do so when there is a fifth taxon available and that taxon is sister to one of the taxa involved in introgression. Here, we present divergence-based introgression polarization (DIP), a method for polarizing introgression using patterns of sequence divergence across whole genomes, which operates in a four-taxon context. Thus, DIP can be applied to infer the directionality of introgression when additional taxa are not available. We use simulations to show that DIP can polarize introgression and identify potential sources of bias in the assignment of directionality, and we apply DIP to a well-described hominin introgression event.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1093/gbe/evaa053     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),introgression;hybridization;phylogenomics;phylogenetics;ADAPTIVE INTROGRESSION;INFERRING PHYLOGENY;GENE FLOW;NEANDERTHAL;EVOLUTION;SEQUENCE;HYBRIDIZATION;EXAMPLE,,

These methods, however, make simplifying assumptions, among them that clades are always increasing or stable in diversity, an assumption we know to be false. This study simulates hypothetical clades to test whether the Binary State Speciation and Extinction (BiSSE) method can be used to correctly detect relative differences in diversification rate between ancestral and derived character states even as net diversification rates are declining overall. We simulate clades with declining but positive diversification rates, as well those in which speciation rates decline below extinction rates so that they are losing richness for part of their history. We run these analyses both with simulated symmetric and asymmetric speciation rates to test whether BiSSE can be used to detect them correctly.        Results: for simulations with a neutral character, the fit for a BiSSE model with a neutral character is better than alternative models so long as net diversification rates remain positive. Once net diversification rates become negative, the BiSSE model with the greatest likelihood often has a non neutral character, even though there is no such character in the simulation. BiSSE's usefulness in detecting real asymmetry in speciation rates improves with clade age, even well after net diversification rates have become negative.        Conclusions: BiSSE is most useful in analyzing clades of intermediate age, before they have reached peak diversity and gone into decline. After this point, users of BiSSE risk incorrectly inferring differential evolutionary rates when none exist. Fortunately, most studies using BiSSE and similar models focus on rapid, recent diversifications, and are less likely to encounter the biases BiSSE models are subject to for older ciades. For extant groups that were once more diverse than now, however, caution should be taken in inferring past diversification patterns without fossil data.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  27 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1186/S12862-018-1174-5     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Character evolution;Systematics;BiSSE;Simulated evolution;TRAIT-DEPENDENT SPECIATION;FOSSIL RECORD;MOLECULAR PHYLOGENIES;DIVERSIFICATION RATES;DIVERSITY;INFERENCES;EVOLUTION;MODEL,,

With this method, only the presence or absence of the target species is recorded on plots and thus the method is straightforward to apply and less prone to surveyor judgement compared to other vegetation monitoring methods. However, in the basic setting, all plots must be equally large or otherwise it is unclear how data should be analysed. In this study, we propose and evaluate five different methods for estimating plant density based on presence-absence registrations from surveys with variable plot sizes.        Using artificial plant population data as well as empirical data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory, we evaluated the performance of the proposed methods. The main analysis was conducted through sampling simulation in artificial populations, whereby bias and variance of density estimators for the different methods were quantified and compared.        Both for state and change estimation of plant density, we found that the best method to handle variable plot size was to perform generalized least squares regression, using plot size as an independent variable. Methods where plots smaller than a certain threshold were excluded or their registrations recalculated were, however, almost as good. Using all registrations as if they were obtained from plots with the nominal plot size resulted in substantial bias.        Our findings are important for plant population studies in a wide range of environmental monitoring programmes. In these programmes, plots are typically randomly laid out and may be located across boundaries between different land-use or land-cover classes, resulting in subplots of variable size. Such splitting of plots is common when large plots are used, for example, with the 100 m(2) plots used in the Swedish National Forest Inventory. Our methods overcome problems to estimate plant density from presence-absence data observed in plots that vary in size.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  34 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/2041-210X.13348,divided plots;intensity;plant density;plant monitoring;point pattern;Poisson model;quadrats;vegetation survey;FOREST;VEGETATION;BIAS,,

Here, we develop capture-recapture models to analyse network data while accounting for imperfect and heterogeneous detection. We carry out a simulation study to validate our approach. In addition, we show how the visualisation of networks and the calculation of standard metrics can account for detection probabilities.

Distance sampling is a common survey method in wildlife studies, because it allows accounting for imperfect detection. The framework has been extended to hierarchical distance sampling (HDS), which accommodates the modelling of abundance as a function of covariates, but rare and elusive species may not yield enough observations to fit such a model.        2. We integrate HDS into a community modelling framework that accommodates multi-species spatially replicated distance sampling data. The model allows species-specific parameters, but these come from a common underlying distribution. This form of information sharing enables estimation of parameters for species with sparse data sets that would otherwise be discarded from analysis. We evaluate the performance of the model under varying community sizes with different species-specific abundances through a simulation study. We further fit the model to a seabird data set obtained from shipboard distance sampling surveys off the East Coast of the USA.        3. Comparing communities comprised of 5, 15 or 30 species, bias of all community-level parameters and some species-level parameters decreased with increasing community size, while precision increased. Most species-level parameters were less biased for more abundant species. For larger communities, the community model increased precision in abundance estimates of rarely observed species when compared to single-species models. For the seabird application, we found a strong negative association of community and species abundance with distance to shore. Water temperature and prey density had weak effects on seabird abundance. Patterns in overall abundance were consistent with known seabird ecology.        4. The community distance sampling model can be expanded to account for imperfect availability, imperfect species identification or other missing individual covariates. The model allowed us to make inference about ecology of species communities, including rarely observed species, which is particularly important in conservation and management. The approach holds great potential to improve inference on species communities that can be surveyed with distance sampling.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  33     Total Times Cited:  37     Cited Reference Count:  42 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/2041-210X.12518     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bayesian P-value;cluster size;hierarchical model;seabirds;sparse data;wildlife surveys;COUNT DATA;RICHNESS;SEABIRDS;DENSITY;BIAS,,

The need to adequately model individuals' interactions with other group members has been recognized, particularly in order to differentiate the role of social forces in individual movement from environmental factors. However, to date, practical statistical methods, which can include group dynamics in animal movement models, have been lacking. We consider a flexible modelling framework that distinguishes a group-level model, describing the movement of the group's centre, and an individual-level model, such that each individual makes its movement decisions relative to the group centroid. The basic idea is framed within the flexible class of hidden Markov models, extending previous work on modelling animal movement by means of multistate random walks. While in simulation experiments parameter estimators exhibit some bias in non-ideal scenarios, we show that generally the estimation of models of this type is both feasible and ecologically informative. We illustrate the approach using real movement data from 11 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). Results indicate a directional bias towards a group centroid for reindeer in an encamped state. Though the attraction to the group centroid is relatively weak, our model successfully captures group-influenced movement dynamics. Specifically, as compared to a regular mixture of correlated random walks, the group dynamic model more accurately predicts the non-diffusive behaviour of a cohesive mobile group. As technology continues to develop, it will become easier and less expensive to tag multiple individuals within a group in order to follow their movements. Our work provides a first inferential framework for understanding the relative influences of individual versus group-level movement decisions. This framework can be extended to include covariates corresponding to environmental influences or body condition. As such, this framework allows for a broader understanding of the many internal and external factors that can influence an individual's movement.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  71     Total Times Cited:  71     Cited Reference Count:  31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/2041-210X.12155     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),behavioural state;hidden Markov model;maximum likelihood;random walk;HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS;STATE-SPACE MODELS;TELEMETRY DATA;BEHAVIOR;Animal Shells;Animals,,

While advances in animal tracking technology have increased our capacity to collect data to support home range analysis, these same advances have also resulted in increasingly autocorrelated data. Consequently, the question of which home range estimator to use on modern, highly autocorrelated tracking data remains open. This question is particularly relevant given that most estimators assume independently sampled data. Here, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of autocorrelation on home range estimation. We base our study on an extensive data set of GPS locations from 369 individuals representing 27 species distributed across five continents. We first assemble a broad array of home range estimators, including Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) with four bandwidth optimizers (Gaussian reference function, autocorrelated-Gaussian reference function [AKDE], Silverman's rule of thumb, and least squares cross-validation), Minimum Convex Polygon, and Local Convex Hull methods. Notably, all of these estimators except AKDE assume independent and identically distributed (IID) data. We then employ half-sample cross-validation to objectively quantify estimator performance, and the recently introduced effective sample size for home range area estimation ((N) over cap (area)) to quantify the information content of each data set. We found that AKDE 95% area estimates were larger than conventional IID-based estimates by a mean factor of 2. The median number of cross-validated locations included in the hold-out sets by AKDE 95% (or 50%) estimates was 95.3% (or 50.1%), confirming the larger AKDE ranges were appropriately selective at the specified quantile. Conversely, conventional estimates exhibited negative bias that increased with decreasing (N) over cap (area). To contextualize our empirical results, we performed a detailed simulation study to tease apart how sampling frequency, sampling duration, and the focal animal's movement conspire to affect range estimates. Paralleling our empirical results, the simulation study demonstrated that AKDE was generally more accurate than conventional methods, particularly for small (N) over cap (area). While 72% of the 369 empirical data sets had >1,000 total observations, only 4% had an (N) over cap (area) >1,000, where 30% had an (N) over cap (area) <30. In this frequently encountered scenario of small <(N)over cap>(area), AKDE was the only estimator capable of producing an accurate home range estimate on autocorrelated data.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  75     Total Times Cited:  76     Cited Reference Count:  96 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1002/ecm.1344     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),animal movement;kernel density estimation;local convex hull;minimum convex polygon;range distribution;space use;telemetry;tracking data;GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM;BEHAVIORAL-CHANGES;ANIMAL BEHAVIOR;MOVEMENT DATA;SAMPLE-SIZE;TELEMETRY;DENSITY;TIME;CONSERVATION;SPACE;Bias (Epidemiology),,

So far this approach was restricted to single change point detection and we propose a straightforward analytical framework based on a recent multiple change point algorithm: the PELT algorithm, a dynamic programming pruning search method to find, within time series, the optimal combination of number and locations of change points. Data segments found by the algorithm are then sorted out with a supervised classification tree procedure to organize segments by movement classes. We apply this framework to investigate changes in variance in daily distances of a migratory bird, the Macqueen's Bustard, Chlamydotis macqueenii, and describe its movements in three classes: staging, non-migratory and migratory movements. Using simulation experiments, we show that the algorithm is robust to identify exact behavioral shift (on average more than 80% of the time) but that positive autocorrelation when present is likely to lead to the detection of false change points (in 36% of the iterations with an average of 1.97 (SE = 0.06) additional change points). A case study is provided to illustrate the biases associated with visual analysis of movement patterns compared to the reliability of our analytical framework. Technological improvement will provide new opportunities for the study of animal behavior, bringing along huge and various data sets, a growing challenge for biologists, and this straightforward and standardized framework could be an asset in the attempt to decipher animal behavior.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  44 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.3389/fevo.2014.00030     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),animal tracking;time series data;change point analysis;PELT algorithm;supervised classification tree;Chlamydotis macqueenii;migration;OSPREYS PANDION-HALIAETUS;MIGRATION PATTERNS;AUTUMN MIGRATION;TRACKING;MODELS;Animals;Algorithms;Animal Shells,,

Occupancy models are frequently used to address this, but it is unclear what spatial scale the data represent. Although individual cameras monitor animal activity within a small target window in front of the device, many practitioners use these data to infer animal presence over larger, vaguely-defined areas. Animal movement is generally presumed to link these scales, but fine-scale heterogeneity in animal space use could disrupt this relationship. Methods We deployed cameras at 10 m intervals across a 0.6 ha forest plot to create an unprecedentedly dense sensor array that allows us to compare animal detections at these two scales. Using time-stamped camera detections we reconstructed fine-scale movement paths of four mammal species and characterized (a) how well animal use of a single camera represented use of the surrounding plot, (b) how well cameras detected animals, and (c) how these processes affected overall detection probability, p. We used these observations to parameterize simulations that test the performance of occupancy models in realistic scenarios. Results We document two important aspects of animal movement and how it affects sampling with passive detectors. First, animal space use is heterogeneous at the camera-trap scale, and data from a single camera may poorly represent activity in its surroundings. Second, cameras frequently (14-71%) fail to record passing animals. Our simulations show how this heterogeneity can introduce unmodeled variation into detection probability, biasing occupancy estimates for species with low p. Conclusions Occupancy or population estimates with camera traps could be improved by increasing camera reliability to reduce missed detections, adding covariates to model heterogeneity in p, or increasing the area sampled by each camera through different sampling designs or technologies.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  7     Cited Reference Count:  39 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s40462-021-00277-3     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PRESENCE-ABSENCE DATA;OCCUPANCY;COMMUNITIES;DISTANCE;MODELS,,

Biologists have long sought to assess the extent to which these events may have impacted particular groups. We present a novel method for detecting the impact of mass-extinction events on molecular phylogenies, even in the presence of tree-wide diversification-rate variation and in the absence of additional information from the fossil record. Our approach is based on an episodic stochastic-branching process model in which rates of speciation and extinction are constant between events. We model three types of events: (i) instantaneous tree-wide shifts in speciation rate; (ii) instantaneous tree-wide shifts in extinction rate and (iii) instantaneous tree-wide mass-extinction events. Each type of event is modelled as an independent compound Poisson process (CPP), where the waiting times between events are exponentially distributed with event-specific rate parameters. The magnitude of each event is drawn from an event-specific prior distribution. Parameters of the model are then estimated in a Bayesian statistical framework using a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. This Bayesian approach enables us to distinguish between tree-wide diversification-rate variation and mass-extinction events by specifying a biologically informed prior on the magnitude of mass-extinction events and empirical hyperpriors on the diversification-rate parameters. We demonstrate via simulation that this method has substantial power to detect the number of mass-extinction events and provides unbiased estimates of the timing of mass-extinction events, while exhibiting an appropriate (i.e. <5%) false-discovery rate, even when background diversification rates vary. Finally, we provide an empirical demonstration of this approach, which reveals that conifers experienced a major episode of mass extinction approximate to 23Ma. This new approach - the CPP on Mass-Extinction Times (CoMET) model - provides an effective tool for detecting the impact of mass-extinction events on molecular phylogenies, even when the history of those groups includes temporal variation in diversification rates and when the fossil history of those groups is poorly known.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  57     Total Times Cited:  57     Cited Reference Count:  67 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/2041-210X.12563     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bayesian inference;birth-death stochastic-branching process;compound Poisson process model;lineage diversification rates;mass extinction;phylogeny;speciation;RECONSTRUCTED EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS;PLANT FOSSIL RECORD;BIRTH-DEATH-MODELS;DEPENDENT SPECIATION;TIME;DIVERSITY;INFERENCE;TREES;SHIFTS;PROBABILITY,,

Recent advancements in analytical tools used in wildlife science may increase our ability to integrate smaller data sets and enhance the statistical power of population estimates. One such advancement, the development of spatial capture-recapture (SCR) methods, explicitly accounts for differences in spatial study designs, making it possible to equate multiple study designs in one analysis. SCR has been shown to be robust to variation in design as long as minimal sampling guidance is adhered to. However, these expectations are based on simulation and have yet to be evaluated in wild populations. Here we conduct a rigorously designed field experiment by manipulating the arrangement of artificial cover objects (ACOs) used to collect data on red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) to empirically evaluate the effects of design configuration on inference made using SCR. Our results suggest that, using SCR, estimates of space use and detectability are sensitive to study design configuration, namely the spacing and extent of the array, and that caution is warranted when assigning biological interpretation to these parameters. However, estimates of population density remain robust to design except when the configuration of detectors grossly violates existing recommendations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  40 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Minor part of study",10.1002/eap.2419,red-backed salamanders;spatial capture-recapture;standardization;study design;RED-BACKED SALAMANDER;POPULATION;ECOLOGY;OCCUPANCY;CINEREUS;MODEL,,

Location Applicable worldwide. Methods We computed distance-decay curves from simulated communities to assess how the species range sizes shape the functional form of distance-decay patterns (i.e. negative exponential, power-law or sigmoidal [Gompertz] relationships). Simulations were performed using different sample sizes and species detection probabilities. We also used distribution data of South American mammals to explore the relationship between species range size and the distance-decay form in an empirical dataset. Results Our simulations showed that the power-law is the best supported model when range sizes tend to be small. An increase in range sizes leads to a negative exponential relationship, taking the shape of a sigmoidal (Gompertz) relationship with the largest range size values. Similar results have been found in the distance-decay pattern of South American mammals. Remarkably, the Gompertz function fits the data reasonably well in all scenarios. Main conclusions The functional form of distance-decay patterns depends on a key biogeographical attribute: species range size. This dependence makes it an interesting tool to detect biodiversity threats associated with species range expansion, such as the biotic homogenization of faunas. The Gompertz function is the mathematical model that best accommodates different frequency distributions of species range size and, thus, allows cross-taxa comparison of this biogeographical and ecological pattern.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/ddi.13550,beta diversity;biological similarity;distance-decay;Gompertz function;range size;sigmoidal relationship;GOMPERTZ FUNCTION;BETA-DIVERSITY;BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION;TURNOVER;NESTEDNESS;COMPONENTS;PATTERNS,,

Currently, Bayesian mixing models (FASTAR and mixSIAR) and a numerical optimization model (QFASA) have been established through various simulations and case stud-ies. To date, validation has yet to be attempted through controlled feedings of both monotypic prey species as well as mixed composition diets to fishes. As such, we evaluate which model provided the most accurate diet es-timates by feeding Lake Trout known mixtures of prey for up to 12 weeks. Visualizations of Lake Trout fatty acid profiles using nMDS or linear discriminant analysis indicated distinct fatty acid profiles for each of the seven diet-treatment groups, with profiles from mixed diet treatments within a resource polygon outlined by those from monotypic diet treatments. Despite optimistic ordinations, all three diet estimation methods estimated diet com-positions with errors of 7.3-35.0% per prey item per Lake Trout. Errors did not seem to improve with greater feed-ing time, increases in length, mass, or lipids of Lake Trout, nor with a reduced suite of fatty acids. We cannot rule out the effects of malnutrition or differential nutrient offerings on consumers' fatty acid profiles but argue nor could one with wild organisms. Fatty acid profiles were extracted from whole body samples, and the inclusion of organs and neural tissues may also have influenced results.

These methods are especially powerful for the detection of uniform selection operating across a gene. However, empirical analyses have demonstrated that regions of protein-coding genes exhibiting clusters of amino acid substitutions are subject to different levels of selection relative to other regions of the same gene. To quantify this heterogeneity of selection within coding sequences, we developed Model Averaged Site Selection via Poisson Random Field (MASS-PRF). MASS-PRF identifies an ensemble of intragenic clustering models for polymorphic and divergent sites. This ensemble of models is used within the Poisson Random Field framework to estimate selection intensity on a site-by-site basis. Using simulations, we demonstrate that MASS-PRF has high power to detect clusters of amino acid variants in small genie regions, can reliably estimate the probability of a variant occurring at each nucleotide site in sequence data and is robust to historical demographic trends and recombination. We applied MASS-PRF to human gene polymorphism derived from the 1,000 Genomes Project and divergence data from the common chimpanzee. On the basis of this analysis, we discovered striking regional variation in selection intensity, indicative of positive or negative selection, in well-defined domains of genes that have previously been associated with neurological processing, immunity, and reproduction. We suggest that amino acid-altering substitutions within these regions likely are or have been selectively advantageous in the human lineage, playing important roles in protein function.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  91 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1093/molbev/msx213     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),model averaged site selection;Poisson Random Field;natural selection;polymorphism;divergence;human evolution;POSITIVE DARWINIAN SELECTION;CODON-SUBSTITUTION MODELS;NATURAL-SELECTION;HUMAN GENOME;DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER;DIRECTIONAL SELECTION;MOLECULAR SIGNATURES;FREQUENCY-SPECTRUM;ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION;RAPID EVOLUTION;Base Sequence;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase,,

Another modeling approach, known as the mutation-selection framework, attempts to explicitly account for selective patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a model, substitutions at a given position occur at the neutral or nearly neutral rate when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar fitness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) fitness amino acids have comparatively low (high) rates. Here, we study the use of such a mutation-selection framework as a null model for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous rates, relative to what would be expected under a mutation-selection modeling framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid fitness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive rate. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation-selection models in the detection of adaptation, calling for further model refinements as well as large-scale applications.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  23     Cited Reference Count:  62 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1093/molbev/msw220     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),nearly neutral evolution;epistasis;fitness landscape;Dirichlet process;Markov chain Monte Carlo;AMINO-ACID SITES;POSITIVE SELECTION;NUCLEOTIDE SUBSTITUTION;DELETERIOUS MUTATIONS;PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS;MOLECULAR EVOLUTION;SEQUENCE EVOLUTION;ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION;LIKELIHOOD METHOD;DNA-SEQUENCES;Mutation,,

However, the underlying assumptions about animal movement and space use are often not realistic. This is a missed opportunity because interesting ecological questions related to animal space use, habitat selection, and behavior cannot be addressed with most SCR models, despite the fact that the data collected in SCR studies - individual animals observed at specific locations and times - can provide a rich source of information about these processes and how they relate to demographic rates. We developed SCR models that integrated more complex movement processes that are typically inferred from telemetry data, including a simple random walk, correlated random walk (i.e., short-term directional persistence), and habitat-driven Langevin diffusion. We demonstrated how to formulate, simulate from, and fit these models with standard SCR data using data-augmented Bayesian analysis methods. We evaluated their performance through a simulation study, in which we varied the detection, movement, and resource selection parameters. We also examined different numbers of sampling occasions and assessed performance gains when including auxiliary location data collected from telemetered individuals. Across all scenarios, the integrated SCR movement models performed well in terms of abundance, detection, and movement parameter estimation. We found little difference in bias for the simple random walk model when reducing the number of sampling occasions from T = 25 to T = 15. We found some bias in movement parameter estimates under several of the correlated random walk scenarios, but incorporating auxiliary location data improved parameter estimates and significantly improved mixing during model fitting. The Langevin movement model was able to recover resource selection parameters from standard SCR data, which is particularly appealing because it explicitly links the individual-level movement process with habitat selection and population density. We focused on closed population models, but the movement models developed here can be extended to open SCR models. The movement process models could also be easily extended to accommodate additional ""building blocks"" of random walks, such as central tendency (e.g., territoriality) or multiple movement behavior states, thereby providing a flexible and coherent framework for linking animal movement behavior to population dynamics, density, and distribution.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1002/ecy.3771,abundance;capture-recapture;Langevin diffusion;movement ecology;NIMBLE;population ecology;POPULATION;DENSITY;Animals;Animal Shells,,

These three methodologies have previously been used separately or in pairs to simulate land use change. In this paper, we apply them in combination, using ant colony optimization and cellular automata to manage the spatial distribution of land use, and applying Markov chain and cellular automata to manage the total amount of land use coverage. We first describe the principle and implementation of the model. Then a land use map of an experimental area (Changping, a district of Beijing) based on land use maps from 1988 and 1998 is simulated for 2008 using the model. By analyzing with real situation, accuracy of the simulation result manifests that the model is useful for land use change simulation. And compared with the other two models (CA-Markov model and ACO-CA model), the model is more appropriate in predicting both the quantity and spatial distribution of land use change in the study area. Therefore the model proposed by this paper is capable of simulating land use change. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TELEM performed best across most combinations of capture probabilities, sampling occasions, true densities, and home range configurations, and performance was unaffected by home range shape.

In this paper, we present a new approach to address this question, using the smoothing function, a method not previously recruited into this ecological context. Using simulation techniques, we explore its accuracy in recovering known species distributions from simulated noisy data, and we compare the smoothing function's predictive abilities to two widely used methods in this field, the generalised linear model (GLM) and random forest machine learning. In studying the smoothing function, we are led to consider a new analytical tool for ecology, which we call the environmental manifold. It is given by the shape of the data cloud of sampled environmental predictor variables, and has deep relevance to ecological niche theory. Hitherto not considered in ecological analyses, it plays a fundamental role in understanding the species-environment relationship, and we utilise it to compare the performance and behaviour of these three methods.        The results of our analysis find both random forest and smoothing to be robust to the complexities of the species-environment relationship, and also, to a degree, the shape of the environmental manifold. In contrast, the GLM's accuracy depends heavily on the complexity of the species-environment relationship, and is also affected by the geometry of the environmental manifold. Furthermore, the smoothing function is seen to be more accurate than random forest in every combination of species-environment relationship and environmental manifold shape, and also less affected by sampling bias. This suggests the promising role that such smoothing functions can have in ecological analyses. Our results also support the robustness of random forest machine learning to nonlinearity in both the species-environment relationship, and for the first time, the complexity of the shape of the environmental manifold. We conclude by discussing the implications and uses of the environmental manifold in ecological practice and theory, including its importance for niche theory, understanding species distributions, and conservation policy.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101472,Kernel smoothing;Environmental manifold;Random forest machine learning;Species-environment relationship;Predictive modeling;Hutchinsonian niche;ECOLOGY;NICHES,,

Statistical analysis of these data is complicated by spatial bias in sampling and temporal variability in detection conditions. Advanced methods for analysis of these data are required but are currently underdeveloped. We propose a state-space model (SSM) for observation network data to estimate detailed movements of individual animals. The underlying movement model is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, which is stationary, and therefore has an inherent mechanism that models home range behaviour. An integral part of the approach is the detection function, which models the probability of logging animal presences. The detection function is also used to provide absence information when animals are undetected. Since the ability to detect an animal often depends on time-varying external factors such as environmental conditions, we use covariate information about detection efficiency as control variables. Via simulation, we found that movement estimation error scales log-linearly with network sparsity. This result can be used to indicate the number of stations necessary to achieve a desired upper bound on estimation error. Furthermore, we found that the SSM outperforms existing techniques in terms of estimating detailed movements and that estimates are robust towards mis-specification of the detection function. We also tested the importance of accounting for time-varying detection conditions and found that the probability of making wrong conclusions decreases substantially when covariate information is exploited. The model is used to estimate movements and home range of a humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus) at Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific Ocean. Here, detection conditions have a strong diel component, which is controlled for using detection efficiency information from a reference device. The presented approach enhances the toolbox for analysis of observation network data as collected by acoustic telemetry or potentially other aspiring methods such as camera trapping and mobile phone tagging. By explicitly modelling movement and observation processes, the model integrates all sources of uncertainty and provides a sound statistical basis for making well-informed management decisions from imperfect information.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  28     Cited Reference Count:  24 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/2041-210X.12086     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),acoustic telemetry;detection probability;Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process;state-space model;MARK-RECAPTURE DATA;ACOUSTIC TRACKING;MODELS;TELEMETRY;BEHAVIOR;DESIGN;ARRAY;HOME;Animal Shells;Animals,,

Recently, doubts about the reliability of these methods have emerged. Here we explore how the results are affected by three confounding factors that may affect ecological data to different degrees: spatial autocorrelation of the environmental variables, length of the compositional gradient, and sampling noise. We document that the statistical hypotheses tested in these methods may or may not correspond to the ecological hypotheses of interest. A major discrepancy emerges if a large proportion of sampling units in the analysed dataset share no species, in which case compositional dissimilarities saturate to a fixed maximum value although explanatory dissimilarities do not. With increasing dissimilarity saturation, the explanatory power of regression models decrease, which may lead to the erroneous conclusion that the ecological processes represented by the explanatory variables are not operating. A survey of recent literature suggests that there is a general lack of awareness of this problem, although it appears to affect > 10% of relevant studies. Our simulations show that if dissimilarity saturation is due to a long ecological gradient, extended dissimilarities essentially solve the problem for any degree of saturation. Using distances from a hybrid multidimensional scaling alleviates the saturation problem when the degree of saturation is < 60%. However, neither correction method can provide a solution to problems caused by insufficient sampling. How the presence of multiple explanatory gradients in combination with sampling noise affects overall analysis performance remains to be clarified.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  51     Total Times Cited:  53     Cited Reference Count:  29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07339.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),EXPLAINING BETA DIVERSITY;MULTIPLE-REGRESSION;SPATIAL-ANALYSIS;MANTEL TEST;DISSIMILARITY;DISTINGUISH;PATTERNS;DISTANCE;FORESTS;TOOL,,

A critical assumption of basic occupancy models is that sites are occupied throughout the duration of the study, which is unlikely to be true for typical bird point-count studies. As such, we evaluated the implications of mobile animals on parameter estimates. We simulated the movement and detection of individual birds using an individual-based simulation model. We fit the basic occupancy model to data that represented a range of animal mobility, and determined the bias relative to known parameters used in the simulation. Occupancy depends on the size of the site selected, with smaller sites leading to lower occupancy for a given area and number of individuals present. At low animal density, occupancy scales approximately linearly with the area of sites, but at very high density, occupancy asymptotes at 1.0 across all site sizes. Even small amounts of movement lead to bias in estimates of occupancy and detectability, and the typical size of bird home ranges can lead to highly biased parameters. Moreover, variation in home range size over time or across habitats can lead to varying degrees of bias. Because of the potential for large bias in occupancy estimates, and their sensitivity to behaviors of birds (e.g., home range size), we recommend against applying current occupancy models to bird point-count data.

However, it is often difficult to assess the efficacy of control methods due to limited resources for monitoring. Managers may view effort on monitoring as effort taken away from performing management actions. We developed a method to estimate invasive species abundance, evaluate management effectiveness, and evaluate population growth over time from a combination of removal activities (e.g., trapping, ground shooting) using only data collected during removal efforts (method of removal, date, location, number of animals removed, and effort). This dynamic approach allows for abundance estimation at discrete time points and the estimation of population growth between removal periods. To test this approach, we simulated over 1 million conditions, including varying the length of the study, the size of the area examined, the number of removal events, the capture rates, and the area impacted by removal efforts. Our estimates were unbiased (within 10% of truth) 81% of the time and were correlated with truth 91% of the time. This method performs well overall and, in particular, at monitoring trends in abundances over time. We applied this method to removal data from Mingo National Wildlife Refuge in Missouri from December 2015 to September 2019, where the management objective is elimination. Populations of feral swine on Mingo NWR have fluctuated over time but showed marked declines in the last 3-6 months of the time series corresponding to increased removal pressure. Our approach allows for the estimation of population growth across time (from both births and immigration) and therefore, provides a target removal rate (above that of the population growth) to ensure the population will decline. In Mingo NWR, the target monthly removal rate is 18% to cause a population decline. Our method provides advancement over traditional removal modeling approaches because it can be applied to evaluate management programs that use a broad range of removal techniques concurrently and whose management effort and spatial coverage vary across time.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Maybe""}",10.1002/eap.2623,dynamic model;invasive species management;multi-method framework;removal sampling;simulation analysis;Sus scrofa;DETECTION PROBABILITY PARAMETERS;MULTISCALE OCCUPANCY ESTIMATION;ESTIMATING SITE OCCUPANCY;SUS-SCROFA;WILD PIGS;REMOVAL;RECAPTURE;ABUNDANCE;CAPTURE;AVAILABILITY,,

As a result, sampling probability is geographically uneven, which may confound the model's characterization of the species' distribution. Modelers frequently address sampling bias by manipulating training data: either subsampling presence data or creating a similar spatial bias in non-presence background data. We tested a new method, which we call 'background thickening', in the latter category. Background thickening entails concentrating background locations around presence locations in proportion to presence location density. We compared background thickening to two established sampling bias correction methods - target group background selection and presence thinning - using simulated data and data from a case study. In the case study, background thickening and presence thinning performed similarly well, both producing better model discrimination than target group background selection, and better model calibration than models without correction. In the simulation, background thickening performed better than presence thinning when the number of simulated presence locations was low, and vice versa. We discuss drawbacks to target group background selection, why background thickening and presence thinning are conservative but robust sampling bias correction methods, and why background thickening is better than presence thinning for small sample sizes. Particularly, background thickening is advantageous for treating sampling bias when data are scarce because it avoids discarding presence records.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  26     Total Times Cited:  26     Cited Reference Count:  57 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/ecog.04503     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),bias correction;Maxent;presence-background modeling;presence thinning;sampling bias;species distribution model;target group background selection;virtual species;POINT PROCESS MODELS;SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION;COLLECTION DATA;SAMPLING BIAS;NICHE;PERFORMANCE;MAXENT;IMPROVE;ABSENCE;REDUCE;Bias (Epidemiology),,

The philosophy underlying risk assessment should be robust to these limitations. While there is a broad support for the concept of risk assessments, there is a tendency to rely on expert opinion and exclude formal data analysis, possibly because available information is often scarce. When data analyses are conducted, often much simplified models are advocated, even though this means excluding processes believed by experts to be important. In this manuscript, we ask: should statistical analyses be conducted and decisions modified based on a single datum? How many data points are needed before predictions are meaningful? Given limited data, how complex should models be? Location World-wide. Methods We use simulation approaches with known true' values to assess which inferences are possible, given different amounts of information. We use two metrics of performance: the magnitude of uncertainty (using posterior mean squared error) and bias (using PP plots). We assess six models of relevance to conservation ecologists. Results We show that the greatest reduction in uncertainty occurred at the smallest sample sizes for models examined, and much of parameter space could be excluded. Thus, analyses based on even a single datum potentially can be useful. Further, with only a few observations, the predicted distribution of outcomes matched the probabilities of actual occurrences, even for relatively complex state-space models with multiple sources of stochasticity. Main conclusions We highlight the utility of quantitative analyses even with severely limited data, given existing practices and arguments in the conservation literature. The purpose of our manuscript is in part a philosophical discourse, as modifications are needed to how conservation ecologists are often trained to think about problems and data, and in part a demonstration via simulation analysis.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  39 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/ddi.12062     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bayesian;hierarchical;mixed model;population viability analysis;simulation;uncertainty;POPULATION VIABILITY ANALYSIS;DECISION-MAKING;UNCERTAINTY;SELECTION,,

However, species richness is difficult to measure in the field because some species will almost always be overlooked due to their cryptic nature or the observer's failure to perceive their cues. Common measures of species richness that assume consistent observability across species are inviting because they may require only single counts of species at survey sites. Single-visit estimation methods ignore spatial and temporal variation in species detection probabilities related to survey or site conditions that may confound estimates of species richness. We used simulated and empirical data to evaluate the bias and precision of raw species counts, the limiting forms of jackknife and Chao estimators, and multispecies occupancy models when estimating species richness to evaluate whether the choice of estimator can affect inferences about the relationships between environmental conditions and community size under variable detection processes. Four simulated scenarios with realistic and variable detection processes were considered. Results of simulations indicated that (1) raw species counts were always biased low, (2) single-visit jackknife and Chao estimators were significantly biased regardless of detection process, (3) multispecies occupancy models were more precise and generally less biased than the jackknife and Chao estimators, and (4) spatial heterogeneity resulting from the effects of a site covariate on species detection probabilities had significant impacts on the inferred relationships between species richness and a spatially explicit environmental condition. For a real data set of bird observations in northwestern Alaska, USA, the four estimation methods produced different estimates of local species richness, which severely affected inferences about the effects of shrubs on local avian richness. Overall, our results indicate that neglecting the effects of site covariates on species detection probabilities may lead to significant bias in estimation of species richness, as well as the inferred relationships between community size and environmental covariates.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  19     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1890/14-1248.1     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Alaska, USA;biodiversity;Chao estimator;community size;jackknife estimator;landbirds;multispecies occupancy model;species richness;POPULATION-SIZE;COMMUNITIES;MODELS;OCCUPANCY;BIRDS;RATES;DETECTABILITY;ACCUMULATION;ESTIMATORS;TURNOVER;Bias (Epidemiology);Probability",,

Logistical difficulties and the spatiotemporal variability of populations make estimation of population declines difficult. For statistical reasons, estimates of population decline may be biased when study sites are chosen based on abundance of the focal species. In this situation, apparent population declines are likely to be detected even if there is no decline. This site-selection bias is mentioned in the literature but is not well known. We used simulations and real population data to examine the effects of site-selection biases on inferences about population trends. We used a left-censoring method to detect population-size patterns consistent with site-selection bias. The site-selection bias is an important consideration for conservation biologists, and we offer suggestions for minimizing or mitigating it in study design and analysis.Article impact statement: Estimates of population declines are biased if studies begin in large populations, and time-series data show a signature of such an effect.        Sesgos en la Seleccion de Sitios y las Declinaciones Poblacionales Aparentes en los Estudios a Largo Plazo La deteccion de las declinaciones poblacionales es una tarea muy importante para la biologia de la conservacion. Las dificultades logisticas y la variabilidad espacio-temporal de las poblaciones complican la estimacion de las declinaciones poblacionales. Por razones estadisticas, las estimaciones de las declinaciones poblacionales pueden estar sesgadas cuando se eligen los sitios de estudio con base en la abundancia de la especie focal. En esta situacion, las declinaciones poblacionales aparentes probablemente sean detectadas sin que exista dicha declinacion. Este sesgo en la seleccion del sitio esta mencionado en la literatura, pero sabe poco sobre el. Usamos simulaciones y datos de poblaciones reales para examinar los efectos que tienen los sesgos en la seleccion de sitio sobre las inferencias que se tienen sobre las tendencias poblacionales. Usamos un metodo censurado por la izquierda para detectar los patrones en el tamano poblacional consistentes con el sesgo en la seleccion de sitios. Este sesgo es una consideracion importante para los biologos de la conservacion y ofrecemos sugerencias para minimizarlo o mitigarlo en el analisis y diseno de los estudios.
