However, Spirulina has also been reported (both in preclinical and in clinical scenarios) to exhibit other bioactive effects, including an antitoxic potential. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review of the literature, conducted in TOXNET, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Science Direct-Scopus; all available years were included. Searching criteria included the effects of Spirulina on experimental poisonings from arsenic, cadmium, carbon tetrachloride, deltamethrin, fluoride, hexachlorocyclohexane, iron, lead, lindane, and mercury. RESULTS: In all cases, it was established that the blue-green alga, and its isolated compounds, effectively counteracted these pollutants toxic effects on the exposed organisms. Some molecular mechanisms are proposed, although they have not been fully elucidated yet. CONCLUSION: Spirulina could be a useful coadjuvant agent within clinical practice for treatment of these or other pollutants poisonings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: full text not available",,Humans;Animals;Spirulina;Environmental Exposure/adverse effects;Occupational Exposure/adverse effects;Antidotes/isolation & purification/*pharmacology;Antioxidants/isolation & purification/*pharmacology;Environmental Pollutants/*poisoning;Poisoning/*drug therapy/metabolism;Spirulina/*metabolism,,

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies of the association between PCB exposure and the risk of hypertension. Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase and Web of Science and by reviewing reference lists. Study-specific risk estimates comparing the highest versus lowest quantile of PCB distribution were combined using random-effects models. We identified 10 cross-sectional studies, 6 cohort studies, and 1 nested case-control study. A pooled excess risk of hypertension was found for total PCBs (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.28-2.26), dioxin-like (DL)-PCBs (OR 1.46, 1.19-1.79), but not for non-dioxin like (NDL)-PCBs (OR 1.19, 0.81-1.73) comparing the highest with the lowest quartile of the distribution. According to a dose-response meta-analysis, a linear dose-effect relationship was found for total PCBs [OR 2.23 (95% CI: 1.59-3.14) for 1000 ng PCB/g lipid increase]. This positive association remained when stratifying the analyses by study design (cohort vs cross-sectional studies) and population (general population vs high exposed workers/residents). Among single PCB congeners, DL-PCB 105 and 118, and non-DL-PCB138 and 153 were related to hypertension. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that exposure to PCBs, particularly to DL-PCBs, may be a risk factor for hypertension, independently of other risk factors.","<p>Place: England</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not organochlorine pesticide",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126984,Humans;Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;Middle Aged;Case-Control Studies;Risk Factors;Dioxins;Polychlorinated biphenyls;Hypertension;Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins;Systematic review;Environmental Exposure/*statistics & numerical data;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis/*metabolism;High blood pressure;Hypertension/*epidemiology/metabolism,,

POPs are stable chemicals that are accumulated in living beings and can act as endocrine disruptors or carcinogens on prolonged exposure. Although efforts have been taken to minimize or ban the use of certain POPs, their use is still widespread due to their importance in several industries. As a result, it is imperative that POPs in the ecosystem are degraded efficiently and safely in order to avoid long-lasting environmental damage. This review focuses on the degradation techniques of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), a pollutant that has strong adverse effects on a variety of organisms. Different technologies such as adsorption, bioremediation and advanced oxidation process have been critically analyzed in this study. All 3 techniques have exhibited near complete removal of HCH under ideal conditions, and the median removal efficiency values for adsorption, bioremediation and advanced oxidation process were found to be 80%, 93% and 82% respectively. However, it must be noted that there is no ideal HCH removal technique and the selection of removal method depends on several factors. Furthermore, the fates of HCH in the environment and challenges faced by HCH degradation have also been explained in this study. The future scope for research in this field has also received attention.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",,Ecosystem;Lindane;Environmental;Water;Biodegradation;*Hexachlorocyclohexane;*Persistent Organic Pollutants,,

Methods: The study included 280 incident cases of acute leukaemia and 288 controls frequency matched on gender, age, hospital, and ethnic origin. The data were obtained from standardised face to face interviews of the mothers with detailed questions on parental occupational history, home and garden insecticide use, and insecticidal treatment of pediculosis. Odds ratios were estimated using unconditional regression models including the stratification variables parental socioeconomic status and housing characteristics. Results: Acute leukaemia was observed to be significantly associated with maternal home insecticide use during pregnancy (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.8) and during childhood (OR= 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.4), with garden insecticide use (OR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.3), and fungicide use (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.0 to 6.2) during childhood. Insecticidal shampoo treatment of pediculosis was also associated with childhood acute leukaemia (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.3). Conclusion: The results reported herein support the hypothesis that various types of insecticide exposure may be a risk factor for childhood acute leukaemia. The observed association with insecticidal shampoo treatment of pediculosis, which has never been investigated before, requires further study.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no systematic review of literature",10.1136/oem.2005.023036,Pesticides,,

To assess the possible carcinogenic risk associated with consuming Chesapeake Bay seafood, hypothetical models were constructed using the maximum detected levels of pesticides in fish and shellfish, levels of regional seafood consumption, and reported carcinogenic potentcy factors for the residues in question. Maximum carcinogenic risk ranged above the 10-2 risk level for each of six population groups considered. While chlordecone accounts for over 90% of the carcinogenic burden of each group, there are numerous reasons to interprete cautiously its associated risk (anomalous release, localized pollution, high potency factor, etc.). Without consideration of chlordecone burdens, maximum hypothetical risk levels still range above 10-3 for all six groups. This degree of risk exceeds commonly held acceptable levels by at least one order of magnitude and underscores the need for expanded research and additional refinement of environmental studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no pdf,full text not available",,Disinfectants,,

TRs of the most toxic PCDD/Fs into milk were generally elevated and even higher into eggs. BCFs in excreting adult animals varied widely between studies complicating to hierarchize tissues or congeners, even if liver and fat seemed to bioconcentrate more than lean tissues. Short time studies have clearly shown low BCFs contrarily to field studies showing the highest BCFs. The BCFs of PCDD/Fs in growing animals were higher in liver than in fat or muscle. In contrast to easily bioconcentrating hexachlorinated congeners, octa- and heptachlorinated congeners barely bioconcentrate. PCB transfer into milk and eggs was systematically high for very lipophilic congeners. Highly ortho-chlorinated PCBs were transferred >50% into milk and eggs and even >70% for congeners 123 and 167 into eggs. BCFs of the most toxic PCBs 126 and 169 were significantly higher than for less toxic congeners. BCFs seem generally low in PBDEs except congeners 47, 153 and 154. DDT and its metabolites showed high bioconcentration. Differences between tissues appeared but were masked by a study effect.

After the prohibition of organochlorines, such as DDT, today mainly pyrethroids and organophosphorous insecticides are used. With reliable and sensitive analytical methods for detecting metabolites of organophosphorous and pyrethroid insecticides in urinary specimens of the general population several studies have been published on internal exposure to these insecticides of the population in Germany. In total, data on levels of metabolites of organophosphorous acids in urine of about 1200 children and adults have been published, as well as data on levels of pyrethroid metabolites in urine of about 2100 children and adults. In Germany, reference values for environmental pollutants related to the population are established continuously by the Human Biomonitoring Commission of the German Federal Environmental Agency, preferably based on data gained by representative studies. Reference values are defined as the 95th percentile, rounded off within the 95% confidence interval of the population studied. Since there is a need for reference values to characterise the population's exposure to organophosphates and pyrethroids, and since there are different studies available from Germany that agree quite well with data from other industrialised countries, the Commission has derived reference values from the available data, though none of the studies had fulfilled criteria on representativity. Reference values for metabolites of organophosphorous acids are as follows: DMP 135 mu g/l, DMTP 160 mu g/l and DEP 16 mu g/l and for metabolites of pyrethroids: cis-Cl2CA 1 mu g/l, trans-Cl2CA 2 mu g/l and 3-PBA 2 mu g/l. As the volume-related concentrations of organophosphate and pyrethroid metabolites show no significant age-dependence, the reference values derived are not age-stratified. Though based merely on statistical and not on toxicological data, levels analysed above the reference levels, when reliably measured (verified several times), should prompt environmental health practitioners to search for sources, within the bounds of proportionality. In addition to accidental poisoning, possible sources include indoor contamination following improper pest control operations in homes as well as in pets and food products contaminated by these pesticides.

Three analyses were performed: (1) an analysis including all articles written during the specified time period that listed an estimate of the relative risk of prostate cancer in farmers; (2) an analysis that included only retrospective studies: and (3) an analysis that included only studies reporting a standardized mortality ratio. Positive associations between prostate cancer and farming were found by the analysis including all studies and the analysis limited to the retrospective studies. No association was found with the analysis that included only studies reporting a standard mortality ratio.

Many of these studies focus on individual classes of chemicals, with a few considering a broad range of systemic exposures. As yet, no review process has been undertaken to comprehensively examine these studies. The aims of this review are to: (1) ascertain whether biomonitoring studies pertaining to firefighters demonstrate occupational exposure to volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, and metals; (2) determine and present results of biomonitoring studies; (3) provide any recommendations presented from the literature that may support exposure mitigation; and (4) suggest future study parameters that may assist in providing a greater understanding surrounding the occupational exposure of firefighters. A systematic review was undertaken with regards to firefighters and biomonitoring studies utilising the matrices of blood, urine, semen and breast milk. This yielded 5690 results. Following duplicate removal, inclusion and exclusion criteria screening and full text screening, 34 studies remained for review. Results of over 80% of studies analysed determined firefighters to experience occupational exposure. Results also show firefighters to be exposed to a wide range of toxic chemicals due to fire smoke; potentially exceeding the range of exposure of other occupations. As firefighters may face increased risk of health effects due to the additive, synergistic, and/or antagonistic effects of chemical exposure, all care must be taken to reduce exposure. This may be achieved by considering tactical decisions, increased personal hygiene, and thorough decontamination procedures. Future biomonitoring studies recognising and assessing the range of chemical exposure firefighters face would be beneficial. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",10.1016/j.envres.2020.109562,character(0),,

This is not fully explained by established risk factors. Concurrent, increasing exposure to antiandrogenic environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in fetal life may partially explain this trend. This systematic review assessed available evidence regarding the association between environmental EDC exposure and risk of testicular cancer (seminomas and nonseminomas). Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of English peer-reviewed literature published prior to December 14, 2020 in the databases PubMed and Embase® was performed. Among the 279 identified records, 19 were eligible for quality assessment and 10 for further meta-analysis. The completeness of reporting was high across papers, but over 50% were considered subject to potential risk of bias. Mean age at diagnosis was 31.9 years. None considered effects of EDC multipollutant mixtures. The meta-analyses showed that maternal exposure to combined EDCs was associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer in male offspring [summary risk ratios: 2.16, (95% CI:1.78-2.62), 1.93 (95% CI:1.49-2.48), and 2.78 (95% CI:2.27-3.41) for all, seminoma, and nonseminoma, respectively]. Similarly, high maternal exposures to grouped organochlorines and organohalogens were associated with higher risk of seminoma and nonseminoma in the offspring. Summary estimates related to postnatal adult male EDC exposures were inconsistent. Maternal, but not postnatal adult male, EDC exposures were consistently associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer, particularly risk of nonseminomas. However, the quality of studies was mixed, and considering the fields complexity, more prospective studies of prenatal EDC multipollutant mixture exposures and testicular cancer are needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""}",,Humans;Male;Risk Factors;Prognosis;Testicular Neoplasms;Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects;Endocrine Disruptors/*adverse effects;Testicular Neoplasms/chemically induced/*pathology,,

There is growing experimental evidence that suggests environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals, specifically organochlorine chemicals (OCCs), may play a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, but to date, there are no studies attempting to gather and synthesise the published literature systematically. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this SR is to evaluate the associations between the exposure to OCCs and endometriosis in experimental models (in vivo and in vitro). METHODS: The SR framework has been developed following the guidelines established in National Toxicology Program/ Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP/OHAT) Handbook for Conducting a Literature-Based Health Assessment, which provides a standardised methodology to implement the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to environmental health assessments. The review process will be managed and documented through HAWC, an open-source content management system, to guarantee transparency. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Only experimental studies, in vivo, ex vivo or in vitro, exploring associations between controlled exposures to OCCs and endometriosis and related outcomes will be included. Eligible studies will include peer reviewed articles of any publication date which are sources of primary data. Only studies published in English will be considered. INFORMATION SOURCES: We will apply the search strings to the scientific literature databases NCBI PubMed, Web of Science and SCOPUS. Manual searches will be performed through the list of references of included articles. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS OR RESULTS: Data will be extracted according to a pre-defined set of forms and synthesised in a narrative report. Given sufficient commensurate data, a meta-analysis may also be performed. RISK OF BIAS: A quality assessment will be performed for in vivo and in vitro studies using the NTP/OHAT Risk of Bias Rating Tool for Human and Animal Studies. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE RATING: Following a comprehensive assessment of the quality of evidence for both in vivo and in vitro studies, a confidence rating will be assigned to the body of literature and subsequently translated into a rating on the level of evidence (high, moderate, low, or inadequate) regarding the research question.

They provide habitat to a vast array of aquatic and benthic organisms as well as facilitate the bio-degradation and transformation of organic matter and vital nutrients. Increasing anthropogenic influence introduces multiple stressors to the stream networks resulting in pollution of streambeds, which in turn, have detrimental effects on the overall stream ecosystem health. There is a huge gap in the current understanding of streambed pollution and its impacts, and the widely practiced streambed pollution mitigation strategies lack a holistic approach. In this comprehensive review, we first synthesize the state-of-the-art knowledge of conventional and emerging forms of contaminants, their overall impacts on stream ecosystem functions, and present future directions to comprehend the problem of streambed pollution. We highlight that fine sediments and plastics (found especially in urban streambeds) are among the major physical pollutants causing streambed pollution and the chemical pollutants generally comprise hydrophobic compounds including various legacy contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a wide range of pesticides and a variety of heavy metals. Moreover, in recent years, highly polar and hydrophilic emerging contaminants such as micro-plastics, pharmaceutical waste and personal care products have been identified in riverbeds and streambeds across the world. We stress that the impacts of streambed pollution have been largely studied with discipline-driven perspectives amongst which the ecological impacts have received a lot of attention in the past. To present a comprehensive outlook, this review also synthesizes and discusses most of the understudied hydrological, geomorphological and biochemical impacts of different forms of streambed pollution. Subsequently, we also present a global inventory by compiling information from the published literature to highlight the status of streambed pollution around the globe. In the end, we endorse the positive and negative aspects of the current impact assessment methodologies and also highlight various physical, chemical and biological remediation measures that could be undertaken to alleviate streambed pollution.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",,Ecosystem;Plastics;Environmental Pollution;*Environmental Pollutants;Environmental Monitoring/methods;Rivers/chemistry;*Water Pollutants;Chemical/analysis,,

Thus, here, we present the outcome of a systematic map (SM) to scope, screen and chart evidences from literature dealing with POPs in Polar regions. The SMs strive to produce rigorous guidelines and have recently been proposed as useful and effective tools to summarise growing bodies of research that seek to reduce bias and increase reliability, particularly in the case of high priority and controversial topics. Our SM was based on 125 polar studies, focussing on the most studied target species among those listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List (IUCN Red List).

Organochlorines and pyrethroids affect the nerve membranes and induce electrophysiological effects; organophosphates and carbamates inhibit acetylcholinesterases; nicotine, nereistoxins and chlornicotinyl insecticides affect acetylcholine receptors; avermectins affect GABA receptors; and attractants, repellents, antifeedants and pheromones affect sensory organs. Toxins of Bacillus thuringiensis affect the insect mid gut; organofluorids and arsenates affect energy production; rotenone, dinitrophenols and HCN inhibit respiratory mechanisms; and benzoyl-phenylureas, buprofezin and JH mimics affect insect growth. These classifications are based on the target and primary action of the compounds. A mode of action study should include definitive information of the sequential processes that lead to death of the animal. These are highly complicated processes and effects of the primary, secondary, tertiary, etc, actions on the intact animal should be considered. Few entomologists studied insect toxicology before the 2nd World War. Successful progress in insect toxicology has been stimulated by the development of insect physiology, insect biochemistry, radio tracer techniques, chromatography, electrophysiology, etc. along with the collaborated development of new synthetic insecticides. Risk assessment of insecticides has been performed not only by evaluation of acute toxicity but also chronic toxicity, carcinogenecity, mutagenecity and propagation by Good Laboratory Practices, environmental assessment, etc. Safeties of insecticides were assured by insecticide registration laws. However, the risk assessment of insecticides seems to be unsatisfactory from the view point of endocrine disruption. Mode of action of endocrine disruption compounds is so complicated that experiments on the mode of action of these compounds must cover many related organs and physiological actions through successive generations. As we cite in this review, a report was withdrawn or others have objections. These show how difficult to draw conclusions on endocrine disruption of compounds. Regarding risk assessment of insecticides, we must carefully discuss data in a realistic and science-based manner.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not english,full text not in english",10.1303/jjaez.2000.155,character(0),,

Emerging evidence suggests that environmental contaminants, including pesticides, might play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes. OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that assessed the association between exposure to pesticides and diabetes and we examined the presence of heterogeneity and biases across available studies. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of peer-reviewed original research pertaining to pesticide exposure and diabetes, published until 30st May 2015, with no language restriction, was conducted. Eligible studies were those that investigated potential associations between pesticides and diabetes without restrictions on diabetes type. We included cohort studies, case-control studies and cross-sectional studies. We extracted information on study characteristics, type of pesticide assessed, exposure assessment, outcome definition, effect estimate and sample size. RESULTS: We identified 22 studies assessing the association between pesticides and diabetes. The summary OR for the association of top vs. bottom tertile of exposure to any type of pesticide and diabetes was 1.58 (95% CI: 1.32-1.90, p=1.21×10(-6)), with large heterogeneity (I(2)=66.8%). Studies evaluating Type 2 diabetes in particular (n=13 studies), showed a similar summary effect comparing top vs. bottom tertiles of exposure: 1.61 (95% CI 1.37-1.88, p=3.51×10(-9)) with no heterogeneity (I(2)=0%). Analysis by type of pesticide yielded an increased risk of diabetes for DDE, heptachlor, HCB, DDT, and trans-nonachlor or chlordane. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological evidence, supported by mechanistic studies, suggests an association between exposure to organochlorine pesticides and Type 2 diabetes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""}",,Humans;Hydrocarbons;Pesticides;Cohort Studies;Cross-Sectional Studies;Diabetes Mellitus;Case-Control Studies;Environmental Pollutants/*analysis;Environmental Exposure/*analysis;Pesticides/*analysis;Chlorinated/*analysis;Type 2/*epidemiology,,

We performed random effects meta-analyses for exposure to all PCBs, specific PCB congeners and risk of all NHL and NHL subtypes. The meta-RR for studies of occupational exposure, high environmental exposure, and no special exposure were 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84-1.03], 1.05 (95% CI: 0.94-1.16), and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.72-1.34), respectively, and the cumulative meta-RR was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.85-1.07). No positive associations were found for exposure to specific congeners, nor for NHL subtypes. The meta-RR for an increase of 100 ppb serum or fat PCB level was 1.02 (95% CI: 1.00-1.04). There was weak indication of publication bias. Our meta-analysis found no association between PCB exposure and NHL risk, in particular in studies of occupational exposures.

Besides, we also tried various types of stratification to identify the more influential confounding factors, among which regional factors have a significant influence. Study evidence suggests that exposure to DDT and its breakdown product, DDE, might be associated with the risk of incident diabetes. Among Asian patients, DDT/DDE concentrations are more closely associated with diabetes.

METHODS: We identified studies from the reference list of the previous meta-analysis and from a MEDLINE search through December 31, 1994. The primary purpose of our analysis was to identify and, if possible, understand the sources of heterogeneity in the literature. Stratified analyses of studies and linear modeling with inverse variance weights were used to assess the impact of study characteristics on results. We calculated summary relative risks as a weighted average of the log relative risks across studies using inverse variance weights. Fixed and random effects models were used as appropriate. RESULTS: The results for most cancers were markedly heterogeneous by study design and, for fewer cancers, by geographic location, and whether the studies focused on crop and livestock farmers. There was some indication of publication bias due to underreporting of near null or sub null findings. Lip cancer was the only cancer that was clearly elevated among farmers. CONCLUSIONS: The results do not suggest that farmers have elevated rates of several cancers. However, the known heterogeneity of exposures by type of farming, geographic area, time period, and other factors limits the informativeness of meta-analyses of these studies for assessing potential carcinogenic exposures in agriculture.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not organochlorine,not organochlorine pesticide",10.1016/S1047-2797(97)00120-8,Neoplasms,,

My aim was to conduct a systematic review of the interactive effects of anthropogenic drivers on endocrine responses in non-human animals. The interaction between temperature and light can disrupt reproduction and growth by impacting gonadotropins, thyroid hormones, melatonin, and growth hormone. Temperature and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) interact to modify reproduction with differential effects across generations. The combined effects of light and EDCs can be anxiogenic, so that light-at-night could increase anxiety in wildlife. Light and noise increase glucocorticoid release by themselves, and together can modify interactions between individuals and their environment. The literature detailing interactions between drivers is relatively sparse and there is a need to extend research to a broader range of taxa and interactions.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the main characteristics and findings of all studies conducted in Spain that quantitatively assessed the influence of diet on human concentrations of POPs. METHODS: Studies published until December 2010 (with no other time restrictions) were identified through Medline/PubMed, ISI-Thomson, ScienceDirect, and SciELO databases. RESULTS: We identified 25 papers, from 19 different studies. Twelve papers were published in 2009-2010. All studies but one were based on subgroups not representative of the general population, and over half were limited to women. Serum was the most used biological matrix, while p,p'-DDE, HCB and PCBs were the most frequently analyzed compounds. Food intakes were measured with heterogeneous food frequency questionnaires. The most consistent association was between fish consumption and PCBs and HCB, followed by dairy products and PCBs. A few studies observed a relationship between meat and some POPs, whilst intake of vegetables, fruits and cereals was rarely related to POP levels. Only 3 studies did not find any relationship between dietary habits and POP concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of methodological heterogeneity, the studies were able to quantify to what extent consumption of foods from animal origin (fish, milk, dairy products and meat) is related to higher body concentrations of POPs. As in a few other countries, in Spain food consumption is increasingly analyzed as a major determinant of human POP intake.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",,Humans;Animals;Spain;Humanism;Humanities;Food Analysis;Environmental Pollutants/*analysis/metabolism;Dairy Products/analysis/statistics & numerical data;Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene/analysis/metabolism;Diet Surveys;Diet/*statistics & numerical data;Environmental Exposure/*analysis/statistics & numerical data;Hexachlorobenzene/analysis/metabolism;Meat/analysis/statistics & numerical data;Organic Chemicals/*analysis/metabolism;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis/metabolism;Seafood/analysis/statistics & numerical data,,

The risk assessment of and uncertainty about applied pesticides are poorly explored due to weak regulatory systems, farmer ignorance, intensive agricultural practices, and lack of available research data on improper handling of pesticides on farming lands with poor phytosanitary management. However, increasing evidence suggests that the prevalence of pesticides in common foodstuffs is due to their uptake by crops and improper management of crop protection practices. Besides, the biotransformation of pesticides in common Bangladeshi food products is poorly understood. Several studies have reported higher concentrations of pesticides than allowed by European Union guidelines in Bangladeshi foodstuffs. However, to date, no systematic review with critical discussion on current research findings and knowledge gaps concerning fate, uncertainty, and health risks of pesticides in the foodstuffs of Bangladesh is published. Therefore, this review summarizes the findings of existing literature on pesticide residue in foodstuffs and points out the weaknesses in the regulatory system and risk assessments for highlighting the critical challenges to food safety in Bangladesh as compared to global food policy.

However, many studies so far have been small, focused on transplacental exposure, used an inappropriate measure to assess postnatal exposure through breastfeeding if any, or did not discern between prenatal and postnatal effects. OBJECTIVES: We investigated prenatal and postnatal exposure to POPs and infant growth (a predictor of obesity). METHODS: We pooled data from seven European birth cohorts with biomarker concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (PCB-153) (n = 2,487), and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) (n = 1,864), estimating prenatal and postnatal POPs exposure using a validated pharmacokinetic model. Growth was change in weight-for-age z-score between birth and 24 months. Per compound, multilevel models were fitted with either POPs total exposure from conception to 24 months or prenatal or postnatal exposure. RESULTS: We found a significant increase in growth associated with p,p'-DDE, seemingly due to prenatal exposure (per interquartile increase in exposure, adjusted β = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.22). Due to heterogeneity across cohorts, this estimate cannot be considered precise, but does indicate that an association with infant growth is present on average. In contrast, a significant decrease in growth was associated with postnatal PCB-153 exposure (β = -0.10; 95% CI: -0.19, -0.01). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date of POPs exposure and infant growth, and it contains state-of-the-art exposure modeling.

Data on available concentrations of persistent toxic substances in the different environmental compartments and their impacts on the ecosystem, and humans have been assembled and summarized. Despite extensive studies, most of the data available deal with limited studies or hot spot situations. Localized inputs of PTS have been identified from freshwater discharges in coastal areas (e.g., Nile estuaries and coastal lakes) and near sewage outfalls from highly industrialized and populated cities. Data are often missing for certain contaminants and in some compartments and geographical areas. The lack of standardized methodologies makes it difficult to compare and use existing data to provide exact conclusions on spatial and temporal trends. In spite of these restrictions, available data indicate that it is unlikely that present levels of cyclodiene pesticides would adversely affect marine organisms. Compounds which are proven to be of concern are DDT, PCBs, gamma-HCH, PAHs, HCB and organotin compounds. Other compounds are suspected to be ubiquitous but data are lacking. Based on few recent data, the reported levels of organochlorine pesticides in fish and human milk samples suggest a concentration decline during the 1990s consistent with the regulatory restrictions on the use of these compounds. It is essential to activate monitoring programs to fill data gaps in appropriate abiotic and biotic.

Methods: Studies were identified from a MEDLINE search through 30 November 2011 and from the reference lists of identified publications. Relative risk (RR) estimates were extracted from 12 studies published between 1985 and 2011. Meta-rate ratio estimates (mRR) were calculated according to fixed and random-effect meta-analysis models. Meta-analyses were performed on the whole set of data and separate analyses were conducted after stratification for gender, exposure characterisation, PD cases identification, geographic location, reported risk estimator and cohort study design. Results: A statistically significant increased risk of PD was observed when all studies were combined (mRR = 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.59) but there was a high heterogeneity and inconsistency among studies. The highest increased risks were observed for studies with the best design, i.e. reporting PD diagnosis confirmed by a neurologist (mRR = 2.56; CI: 1.46-4.48; n=4), for cohort studies reporting incidence of PD (mRR = 1.95; CI: 1.29-2.97; n=3) as well as for prospective cohorts (mRR = 1.39; CI: 1.09-1.78; n=6). A significant increased risk was also seen for banana, sugarcane and pineapple plantation workers (mRR = 2.05; CI: 1.23-3.42; n=2).

Summary odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random- or fixed-effect models.Results: This meta-analysis included 11 case-control studies, all of which demonstrated a correlation between pesticide exposure and a statistically significant increased risk of MDS (OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.23-3.09). In subgroup analyses, patients with pesticide exposure had increased risk of developing MDS if they were living in the Europe or Asia and had refractory anemia (RA) or RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS). Moreover, in the analysis by specific pesticides, increased risk was associated with exposure to insecticides (OR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.22-2.40) but not exposure to herbicides or fungicides.Conclusion: This meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that exposure to pesticides increases the risk of developing MDS. Further prospective cohort studies are warranted to verify the association and guide clinical practice in MDS prevention. © 2014 Jin et al.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not organochlorine,pesticide exposure and risk,does not distinguish pesticides into chemical classes",10.1371/journal.pone.0110850,Pesticides;Risk Factors,,

In relation to this, in addition to infection, factors associated with working with chemical insecticides are a cause for concern. Some of the chemicals involved have been shown to affect the respiratory system, and consequentially workers are at increased risk of conditions such as asthma. However, medical opinion around this area is still controversial; therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the association between exposure to insecticides and asthma by means of a systematic review of the relevant literature. Relevant literature was identified, and a systematic review was conducted to investigate the association between exposure to insecticides and asthma. A total of five studies (three cross sectional and two cohort) including 45,435 subjects were identified as relevant. The summary odds ratios related to the impact of exposure to specific insecticides on asthma were organophosphates 1.31 (95%CI = 1.17-1.48, I(2) = 27%, p = 0.172), carbamates 1.44 (95%CI 1.08-1.92, I(2) = 56.7%, p = 0.031) and organochlorines 1.31 (95%CI 1.19-1.64, I(2) = 37.3%, p = 0.131).

Despite the ban of DDT and HCH in India, they are still in use, both in domestic and agricultural settings. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the production and consumption of persistent organic pesticides, their maximum residual limit (MRL) and the presence of persistent organic pesticides in multicomponent environmental samples (air, water and soil) from India. In order to highlight the global distribution of persistent organic pesticides and their impact on neighboring countries and regions, the role of persistent organic pesticides in Indian region is reviewed. Based on a review of research papers and modeling simulations, it can be concluded that India is one of the major contributors of global persistent organic pesticide distribution. This review also considers the health impacts of persistent organic pesticides, the regulatory measures for persistent organic pesticides, and the status of India's commitment towards the elimination of persistent organic pesticides.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",,Pesticides;India;Environmental Pollutants/*analysis;Pesticides/*analysis;*Environmental Monitoring;Environmental Pollution/*statistics & numerical data,,

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of scientific literature on the relationship between PCB exposure and human cancer. Two cohorts of people highly exposed to PCBs through ingestion of contaminated rice oil and some cohorts of occupationally exposed workers failed to show a definite increase in total cancer mortality and provided inconsistent results regarding single cancers.

We analysed the outermost tail feathers of 8 terrestrial and aquatic bird species from Belgium (8 species, n=108) for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Every compound class could be quantified in one single tail feather of the birds under study (sum PCBs ranging from 5.5 to 510 ng/g feather, sum PBDEs from 0.33 to 53 ng/g feather, sum DDTs from 1.5 to 730 ng/g feather), except for PBDEs in feathers of the common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus). Further, we calculated Pearson correlations between concentrations of organic pollutants in feathers and concentrations in corresponding muscle or liver tissue from the birds. Correlations were found significant in half of the cases of the terrestrial species, but were found not significant for the aquatic species, with the exception of a significant correlation of sum PCBs in the common moorhen. Only for the common buzzard (Buteo buteo) (n=43) all correlations were found significant (0.32<r<0.77). In order to cope for low statistical power, we performed a meta-analysis on all bird species together. This led to significant correlations between levels in feathers and corresponding levels in muscle or liver for all terrestrial birds (p<0.05 in all cases, effect size 0.59 (p,p'-DDE) to 0.71 (Sigma PCB) for levels in feather and muscle). When correlations were recalculated excluding the birds that had died due to starvation, correlation coefficients for the terrestrial birds were found even higher (effect size up to 0.83 (Sigma PCB)). These results have important implications for non-destructive and retrospective biomonitoring. Although our results suggest that exact concentrations in the body cannot be predicted using feathers, bird feathers can give a good estimate of contamination levels in a population and as such are a potential non-destructive biomonitoring tool for organic pollutants. Outermost tail feathers and muscle tissue were also examined for nitrogen (delta15N) and carbon (delta13C) stable isotope content in the different bird species. However, delta15N/delta13C signatures in feather or muscle were not significantly correlated with the corresponding levels of organic pollutants in these tissues. Various confounding factors (such as habitat, condition, age, sex) may have masked a relationship between delta15N values and organic pollutant levels in the birds under study.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not impact of organochlorine pesticides",,Hydrocarbons;Animals;Belgium;Birds;Meta-Analysis as Topic;Environmental Pollutants/*analysis;Environmental Monitoring/*methods;Liver/metabolism;Pesticides/analysis;Muscles/metabolism;Feathers/*chemistry;Flame Retardants/analysis;Phenyl Ethers/analysis;Polybrominated Biphenyls/analysis;Chlorinated/analysis,,

Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) have become omnipresent in our environment. Individuals may or may not experience clinical health issues from being exposed to the increasing environmental pollution in daily life, but an issue of high concern is that also the non-exposed progeny may encounter consequences of these ancestral exposures. Progress in understanding epigenetic mechanisms opens new perspectives to estimate the risk of man-made EDCs. However, the field of epigenetic toxicology is new and its application in public health or in the understanding of disease etiology is almost non-existent, especially if it concerns future generations. In this review, we investigate the literature on transgenerational inheritance of diseases, published in the past 10 years. We question whether persistent epigenetic changes occur in the male germ line after exposure to synthesized EDCs. Our systematic search led to an inclusion of 43 articles, exploring the effects of commonly used synthetic EDCs, such as plasticizers (phthalates and bisphenol A), pesticides (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, atrazine, vinclozin, methoxychlor), dioxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, such as benzo(a)pyrene). Most studies found transgenerational epigenetic effects, often linked to puberty- or adult-onset diseases, such as testicular or prostate abnormalities, metabolic disorders, behavioral anomalies, and tumor development. The affected epigenetic mechanisms included changes in DNA methylation patterns, transcriptome, and expression of DNA methyltransferases. Studies involved experiments in animal models and none were based on human data. In the future, human studies are needed to confirm animal findings. If not transgenerational, at least intergenerational human studies and studies on EDC-induced epigenetic effects on germ cells could help to understand early processes of inheritance. Next, toxicity tests of new chemicals need a more comprehensive approach before they are introduced on the market. We further point to the relevance of epigenetic toxicity tests in regard to public health of the current population but also of future generations. Finally, this review sheds a light on how the interplay of genetics and epigenetics may explain the current knowledge gap on transgenerational inheritance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",,Male;Animals;Epigenesis;Mammals;Mice;Paternal Inheritance;Epigenomics;Endocrine Disruptors/*toxicity;Dioxins/toxicity;Phthalic Acids/toxicity;Atrazine/toxicity;Benzhydryl Compounds/toxicity;Benzo(a)pyrene/toxicity;DDT/toxicity;Phenols/toxicity;Genetic/*drug effects,,

Large studies with substantial exposure contrasts and appropriate exposure assessment are warranted. Within the framework of the EU (European Union) ENRIECO (ENvironmental Health RIsks in European Birth Cohorts) and EU OBELIX (OBesogenic Endocrine disrupting chemicals: LInking prenatal eXposure to the development of obesity later in life) projects, we examined the hypothesis that the combination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) adversely affects birth weight. METHODS: We used maternal and cord blood and breast milk samples of 7,990 women enrolled in 15 study populations from 12 European birth cohorts from 1990 through 2008. Using identical variable definitions, we performed for each cohort linear regression of birth weight on estimates of cord serum concentration of PCB-153 and p,p´-DDE adjusted for gestational age and a priori selected covariates. We obtained summary estimates by meta-analysis and performed analyses of interactions. RESULTS: The median concentration of cord serum PCB-153 was 140 ng/L (range of cohort medians 20-484 ng/L) and that of p,p´-DDE was 528 ng/L (range of cohort medians 50-1,208 ng/L). Birth weight decreased with increasing cord serum concentration of PCB-153 after adjustment for potential confounders in 12 of 15 study populations. The meta-analysis including all cohorts indicated a birth weight decline of 150 g [95% confidence interval (CI): -250, -50 g] per 1-µg/L increase in PCB-153, an exposure contrast that is close to the range of exposures across the cohorts. A 1-µg/L increase in p,p´-DDE was associated with a 7-g decrease in birth weight (95% CI: -18, 4 g). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that low-level exposure to PCB (or correlated exposures) impairs fetal growth, but that exposure to p,p´-DDE does not. The study adds to mounting evidence that low-level exposure to PCBs is inversely associated with fetal growth.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""}",,Humans;Male;Cohort Studies;Europe;Female;Pregnancy;Adult;Young Adult;Linear Models;Milk;Sex Factors;Birth Weight;Birth Weight/*drug effects;Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene/analysis/blood/*toxicity;Environmental Pollutants/analysis/blood/*toxicity;Fetal Blood/chemistry;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis/blood/*toxicity;Smoking/adverse effects;Human/chemistry,,

A literature search for cohort studies was conducted in the PubMed, Web of science, and Cochrane databases. Methodological quality of each study was rated with the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) checklist. One thousand one hundred and thirty-two studies were identified. Thirty-two were included. Most of the studies found addressed occupational exposure to pesticides and were conducted in Europe and North America. Eleven high-quality studies were found. Most of them found no association between exposure to pesticides and increased risk of HNC. Two studies found some evidence of a positive association between pesticide (malathion and atrazine) exposure and thyroid cancer. The literature review does not support a clear evidence for association between pesticides exposure and HNC. Only limited evidence points to a positive association between exposure to some pesticides and thyroid cancer.

Lay abstract: Autism spectrum disorders comprise a complex group with many subtypes of behaviorally defined neurodevelopmental abnormalities in two core areas: deficits in social communication and fixated, restricted, repetitive, or stereotyped behaviors and interests each with potential unique risk factors and characteristics. The underlying mechanisms and the possible causes of autism spectrum disorder remain elusive and while increased prevalence is undoubtable, it is unclear if it is a reflection of diagnostic improvement or emerging risk factors such as endocrine disrupting chemicals. Epidemiological studies, which are used to study the relation between endocrine disrupting chemicals and autism spectrum disorder, can have inherent methodological challenges that limit the quality and strength of their findings.

METHODS: We investigated the relationship of ever use of 14 selected pesticide chemical groups and 33 individual active chemical ingredients with non-Hodgkin lymphoid malignancies (NHL) overall or major subtypes, in a pooled analysis of three large agricultural worker cohorts. Pesticide use was derived from self-reported history of crops cultivated combined with crop-exposure matrices (France and Norway) or self-reported lifetime use of active ingredients (USA). Cox regression models were used to estimate cohort-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which were combined using random effects meta-analysis to calculate meta-HRs. RESULTS: During follow-up, 2430 NHL cases were diagnosed in 316 270 farmers accruing 3 574 815 person-years under risk. Most meta-HRs suggested no association. Moderately elevated meta-HRs were seen for: NHL and ever use of terbufos (meta-HR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.00-1.39); chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and deltamethrin (1.48, 1.06-2.07); and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and glyphosate (1.36, 1.00-1.85); as well as inverse associations of NHL with the broader groups of organochlorine insecticides (0.86, 0.74-0.99) and phenoxy herbicides (0.81, 0.67-0.98), but not with active ingredients within these groups, after adjusting for exposure to other pesticides. CONCLUSIONS: Associations of pesticides with NHL appear to be subtype- and chemical-specific. Non-differential exposure misclassification was an important limitation, showing the need for refinement of exposure estimates and exposure-response analyses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: pooled analysis",,Humans;Male;Pesticides;Female;Middle Aged;Aged;Case-Control Studies;Lymphoma;Risk Factors;Norway;Regression Analysis;France;Age of Onset;*Pesticides;Occupational Exposure/*statistics & numerical data;*Agriculture;United States/epidemiology;France/epidemiology;Norway/epidemiology;80;over;Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology,,

Materials and Methods: Epidemiological studies focused on childhood cancer and exposure to pesticides, conducted over the last seven years, were identified through searching PUBMED, MEDLINE and EBSCO literature bases. From each study, the following information was abstracted: type of cancer, type of exposure, study design, risk estimate, and study population. This review will try to answer the question on whether any further progress in epidemiology of childhood cancer due to pesticide exposure has been made. Results: Leukemia, brain cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and neuroblastoma are mentioned as potentially associated with pesticide exposure among children. Despite an increasing evidence in support of this finding, it is still limited because of the weakness of research methodology. The substantial weak points of numerous epidemiological studies of pesticide-related health effects are problems faced in exposure assessment, small numbers of exposed subjects, a limited number of studies focused on the majority of cancers, and difficulties in estimating critical windows of exposure. Conclusion: In the light of existing, although still limited evidence of adverse effects of pesticide exposure, it is necessary to reduce exposure to pesticides. The literature review suggests a great need to increase awareness among people occupationally or environmentally exposed to pesticides about their potential negative influence on health of their children. © Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: does not distinguish pesticides into chemical classes",10.2478/v10001-006-0024-7,Pesticides,,

Meta-analyses have not yet investigated the association between human-biomonitoring data for POPs and prostate cancer risk. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between body concentration of individual compounds or mixtures of POPs and prostate cancer risk in the general population by performing a meta-analysis. A literature search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and KoreaMed from the period 1950 through 2014. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95 % confidence interval (CI) of prostate cancer associated with POPs were estimated using fixed-effects model or random-effects model where appropriate. Dose-response relationships were assessed by using the generalized least-squares method for trend estimation. A total of eight (six case-control, one cross-sectional, one nested case-control) studies including 1158 prostate cancer cases among 6932 subjects were selected for the meta-analysis. Total POPs of interest showed positive associations with statistical significance on prostate cancer (OR 1.31, 95 % CI 1.13, 1.57). In dose-response meta-analysis, 1 mu g/g lipid of PCBs was found to be associated with a 49 % increased risk of prostate cancer (OR 1.49, 95 % CI 1.07, 2.06). One nanogram per gram (1000 mu g/g) lipid of trans-nonachlor was found to be associated with approximately 2 % increased risk of prostate cancer (OR = 1.02/1 ng/g lipid of trans-nonachlor, 95 % CI 1.00, 1.03). The available evidence suggests that body concentrations of POPs are positively associated with prostate cancer risk, which implies valuable evidence for prostate cancer prevention.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s11356-015-4315-z,Prostatic Neoplasms;Prostate,,

Relatively little is known about the etiology of childhood brain tumor (CBT). While there are several studies which link pesticide exposure to increased risk of CBT, findings have been inconsistent. We performed a meta-analysis on 15 published epidemiological studies to test that in utero exposure to pesticides may be involved in the development of brain cancer in children. Meta-analysis was performed using the general variance-based method and homogeneity was tested by means of the Q statistic. Summary relative risk (RR) estimates were calculated for childhood brain cancer from 1) paternal exposure to pesticides prior to conception, 2) both maternal and paternal exposure to pesticides during pregnancy, 3) maternal exposure during pregnancy to: a. agricultural and b. non-agricultural activities, and 4) childhood exposure to: a. agricultural and b. nonagricultural activities up to date of diagnosis with CBT. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) was used to identify gene-pesticide-CBT interactions. Findings of meta-analyses revealed a significantly increased risk of CBT among children whose mothers had farm-related exposures during pregnancy (RR=1.48, 95% CI=1.18-1.84). A dose response was recognized when this risk estimate was compared to those for risk of CBT from maternal exposure to non-agricultural pesticides (e.g. home extermination, pest strips) during pregnancy (RR=1.36, 1.10-1.68), and risk of CBT among children exposed to agricultural activities (RR=1.32, 1.04-1.67). Three studies combined for the paternal exposure to pesticides during preconception produced a calculated summary risk estimate of odds ratio (OR) = 2.29 (95% CI: 1.39 - 3.78). Meta-analysis of five studies of paternal exposure to pesticides during pregnancy produced a final calculated summary risk estimate of OR = 1.63 (95% CI: 1.16 - 2.31). The search of the CTD databases revealed association between herbicide and astrocytoma and more than 300 genes are altered by exposure to herbicide, fungicide, insecticide or pesticides. In summary, comparing results from our categories of exposure, pre-conception and pregnancy exposure estimates were slightly higher than childhood exposure estimates, paternal exposures produced slightly higher risk estimates compared to maternal exposures, agricultural exposures produced slightly higher risk estimates compared to non-agricultural exposures and CTD search revealed potential genes-pesticides-astrocytoma interactions. Based on the collective results of these meta-analyses it appears that pesticide exposure may increase risk of CBT, with preconception and prenatal exposures being especially important factors in increasing risk of its development. Interestingly, paternal exposure may be as important, if not more important than maternal exposures, particularly during the preconception period. Whether this is a result of paternal exposures being more prevalent than maternal exposures or the consequence of a biological process, is a question that deserves further attention in future investigations of CBT etiology.","<p>20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM), Adelaide, AUSTRALIA, DEC 01-06, 2013</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no pdf,full text not available",,Pesticides;Pregnancy;Brain;Brain Neoplasms,,

Measured and model-predicted spring peak concentrations in waters receiving snowmelt motivate a thorough investigation of organic contaminant behaviour during melting. on the basis of the current understanding of snow metamorphosis, snowmelt hydrology and chemical partitioning in snow, this critical review aims to provide a qualitative picture of the processes involved in the release of organic contaminants from a melting snowpack. The elution sequence of organic substances during snowmelt is strongly dependent on their environmental partitioning properties and the physical properties of the snowpack. Water-soluble organic contaminants can be discharged in greatly elevated concentrations at an early stage of melting, while the bulk of the hydrophobic chemicals attached to particles is often released at the end of the melt period. Melting of a highly metamorphosed and deep snowpack promotes such shock load releases, whereas a shallow snow cover over a relatively warm ground experiencing irregular melting over the winter season is unlikely to generate notable peak releases of organic substances. Meltwater runoff over frozen ground directly transfers contaminant shock loads into receiving water bodies, while permeable soils buffer and dilute the contaminants. A more quantitative understanding of the behaviour of organic contaminants in varying snowmelt scenarios will depend on controlled laboratory studies combined with field investigations. Reliable numerical process descriptions will need to be developed to integrate water quality and contaminant fate models. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there still remains some controversy over the epidemiological evidence regarding the effects of environmental carcinogens on the risk of breast cancer. We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis aiming at full evaluation of the effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on breast cancer in a congener-specific fashion. Four online literature databases were systematically searched before 1st January 2015, for studies stating correlation between PCB congeners and breast cancer. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the studies that were included in our analysis. Sixteen studies were included in our final meta-analysis after screening based on the priori inclusion criteria. Nine PCB congeners were reported by more than two studies and they were presented in detail. The pooled Odds Ratios (ORs) showed a significant increase in the risk of breast cancer in individuals with higher plasma/fat levels of PCB 99 (OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.80), PCB 183 (OR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.25 to 1.95) and PCB 187 (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.39). Besides, the outcomes did not support a relationship between dioxin-like PCB congeners and the risk of breast cancer. The results of our meta-analysis imply that PCB 99, PCB 183 and PCB 187 would increase the risk of breast cancer. The mechanism of this increased risk may be by the induction of the CYP2B family in cytochrome P450 enzymes.","<p>Place: Netherlands</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not organochlorine pesticide",10.1016/j.envint.2015.12.022,Humans;Meta-analysis;Female;Risk Factors;Polychlorinated biphenyls;Breast Neoplasms;Incidence;Odds Ratio;Breast cancer;Breast Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology;Environmental Pollutants/analysis/*toxicity;Congener-specific;Dioxin-like;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis/*toxicity,,
rayyan-894980409,Persistent Organic Pollutants and Type 2 Diabetes: A Critical Review of Review Articles,2018,1,1,FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY,1664-2392,9,,,,,,,,"Low dose persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have emerged as a new risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Despite substantial evidence from human and experimental studies, there are several critical issues which have not been properly addressed by POPs researchers. First, as POPs exist as mixtures, findings about POPs from human studies should be interpreted from the viewpoint of lipophilic chemical mixtures which include both measured and unmeasured POPs. Second, as POPs can directly reduce insulin secretion of beta cells, the role of POPs may be more prominent in the development of beta-cell dysfunction-dominant T2D rather than insulin resistance-dominant T2D. Third, there are multidimensional interrelationships between POPs and adipose tissue. Even though POPs are now considered as a new risk factor for T2D, independent of obesity, POPs and obesity are mechanistically linked to each other. POPs are involved in key mechanisms linking obesity and T2D, such as chronic inflammation of adipose tissue and lipotoxicity with ectopic fat accumulation. Also, POPs can explain puzzling human findings which suggest benefits of obesity because healthy adipose tissue can be protective by reducing the amount of POPs reaching other organs. Fourth, non-linear dose-response relationships between POPs and T2D are biologically possible. Although POPs are well-known endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), mitochondrial dysfunction may be a more plausible mechanism due to unpredictability of EDC mixtures. As adipose tissue plays a role as an internal exposure source of POPs, how to manage POPs inside us may be essential to protect against harms of POPs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",10.3389/fendo.2018.00712,character(0),,

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between exposure to EDCs and obesity. DATA SOURCES, DESIGN AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched from inception to 6 June 2018 for studies primarily addressing the association between exposure to EDCs after the age of 2 years and anthropometric measures of obesity or body fat. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the risk of bias. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers screened and conducted data extraction and synthesis. A third reviewer resolved disagreements. RESULTS: A total of 73 studies investigating bisphenol A (32 286 individuals), organochlorine compounds (34 567 individuals), phthalates (21 401 individuals), polybrominated biphenyls (2937 individuals), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (5174 individuals), parabens (4097 individuals), benzoic acid (3671 individuals) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (349 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Most had a cross-sectional design and low or medium risk of bias. In qualitative analysis, bisphenol A and phthalates were consistently associated with general and abdominal obesity, in children and adults, and some studies suggested this association was age-dependent and gender-dependent. Meta-analysis indicated a significant association between exposure to bisphenol A and overweight (OR 1.254, 95% CI 1.005 to 1.564), obesity (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.273 to 1.774) and increased waist circumference (OR 1.503, 95% CI 1.267 to 1.783) in adults, and between exposure to 2,5-dichlorophenol and obesity in children (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1018 to 3.184). CONCLUSION: Most observational studies supported a positive association between obesity and exposure to EDCs. Although causality cannot be determined from these data, they underscore the need to limit human exposure to EDCs in light of the evidence from animal and cell-based studies indicating the effects of these chemicals on adiposity.

PCBs have been deemed to be probable carcinogens by the Environmental Protection Agency, and exposure to high levels of PCBs has been consistently linked to increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In the present article we present a forensic epidemiologic evaluation of the causal relationship between NHL and elevated PCB levels via application of the Bradford-Hill criteria. Included in the evaluation is a meta-analysis of the results of previously published case-control studies in order to assess the strength of association between NHL and PCBs, resulting in an odds ratio in which the lowest percentile PCB concentration (quartile, quintile, or tertile) has been compared with the highest percentile concentration in the study groups. The weight-adjusted odds ratio for all PCB congeners was 1.43 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.31 to 1.55, indicating a statistically significant causal association with NHL. Because of the lack of an unexposed comparison group, a rationale for the use of a less than 2.0 relative risk causal contribution threshold is presented herein, including an ecologic analysis of NHL incidence and PCB accumulation (as measured by sales volume) over time. The overall results presented here indicate a strong general causal association between NHL and PCB exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",10.1155/2012/258981,"Humans;Lymphoma;Risk Factors;Risk Assessment;Algorithms;Causality;Environmental Pollutants/blood/*toxicity;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/blood/*toxicity;Non-Hodgkin/blood/*epidemiology;Hodgkin Disease;Non-Hodgkin;Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin",,

We conducted a meta-analysis of published studies of ALS and pesticides as a group and investigated the association of ALS with specific pesticides, using data from the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a cohort including 84,739 private pesticide applicators and spouses. AHS participants provided information on pesticide use at enrollment in 1993-1997. In mortality data collected through February 2010, ALS was recorded on death certificates of 41 individuals whom we compared to the remaining cohort (controls), using unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age and gender to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals. In the meta-analysis, ALS was associated with use of pesticides as a group (1.9, 1.1-3.1). In the AHS, ALS was not associated with pesticides as a group, but was associated with use of organochlorine insecticides (OCs) (1.6, 0.8-3.5), pyrethroids (1.4, 0.6-3.4), herbicides (1.6, 0.7-3.7), and fumigants (1.8, 0.8-3.9). ORs were elevated forever use of the specific OCs aldrin (2.1, 0.8-5.1), dieldrin (2.6, 0.9-7.3), DDT (2.1, 0.9-5.0), and toxaphene (2.0, 0.8-4.9). None of these associations was statistically significant. Similar results were observed in an analysis restricted to men. In conclusion, the meta-analysis suggests that ALS risk is associated with use of pesticides as a group, and our analysis of AHS data points to OC use in particular. The latter results are novel but based on a small number of cases and require replication in other populations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",,Humans;Hydrocarbons;Male;Pesticides;Female;Middle Aged;Aged;Logistic Models;Risk Factors;Risk Assessment;Age Factors;Sex Factors;Odds Ratio;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;Spouses;Pesticides/*adverse effects;*Agriculture;*Occupational Exposure;Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*chemically induced/mortality;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/*chemically induced/mortality;Motor Neuron Disease;Chlorinated/*adverse effects,,

(2) which pesticides are most evaluated and detected? and (3) which pesticides have the highest concentrations? Using the Prisma protocol, 146 articles published from 1976 to November 2021 were included in this analysis: 127 studies used grab sampling, 10 used passive sampling, and 9 used both sampling techniques. In the 45-year historical series, the USA, China, and Spain were the countries that conducted the highest number of studies. Atrazine was the most evaluated pesticide (56% of the studies), detected in 43% of the studies using grab sampling, and the most detected in passive sampling studies (68%). The compounds with the highest maximum and mean concentrations in the grab sampling were molinate (211.38 mu g/L) and bentazone (53 mu g/L), respectively, and in passive sampling, they were oxyfluorfen (16.8 mu g/L) and atrazine (4.8 mu g/L), respectively. The levels found for atrazine, p,p `-DDD, and heptachlor in Brazil were higher than the regulatory levels for superficial water in the country. The concentrations exceeded the toxicological endpoint for at least 11 pesticides, including atrazine (Daphnia LC50 and fish NOAEC), cypermethrin (algae EC50, Daphnia and fish LC50; fish NOAEC), and chlorpyrifos (Daphnia and fish LC50; fish NOAEC). These results can be used for planning pesticide monitoring programs in surface freshwater, at regional and global levels, and for establishing or updating water quality regulations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",10.1007/s10661-022-10005-y,Pesticides,,

Results are scattered across many studies and meta-analyses, and they often mix obese and overweight individuals. Materials and methods: PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched through 21 January 2017 for meta-analyses of cohort studies assessing environmental risk factors for obesity, and randomized controlled trials investigating nonpharmacological and nonsurgical therapeutic interventions for obesity. We excluded data on overweight participants. Evidence from observational studies was graded according to criteria that included the statistical significance of the random-effects summary estimate and of the largest study in a meta-analysis, the number of obesity cases, heterogeneity between studies, 95% prediction intervals, small-study effects and excess significance. The evidence of intervention studies for obesity was assessed with the GRADE framework. Results: Fifty-four articles met eligibility criteria, including 26 meta-analyses of environmental risk factors (166 studies) and 46 meta-analyses of nondrug, nonsurgical interventions (206 trials). In adults, the only risk factor with convincing evidence was depression, and childhood obesity, adolescent obesity, childhood abuse and short sleep duration had highly suggestive evidence. Infancy weight gain during the first year of life, depression and low maternal education had convincing evidence for association with paediatric obesity. All interventions had low or very-low-quality evidence with one exception of moderate-quality evidence for one comparison (no differences in efficacy between brief lifestyle primary care interventions and other interventions for paediatric obesity). Summary effect sizes were mostly small across compared interventions (maximum 5.1 kg in adults and 1.78 kg in children) and even these estimates may be inflated. Conclusions: Depression, obesity in earlier age groups, short sleep duration, childhood abuse and low maternal education have the strongest support among proposed risk factors for obesity. Furthermore, there is no high-quality evidence to recommend treating obesity with a specific nonpharmacological and nonsurgical intervention among many available, and whatever benefits in terms of magnitude of weight loss appear small. © 2018 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: umbrella review | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: umbrella review,not organochlorine pesticide | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no OCPs",10.1111/eci.12982,Cohort Studies;Risk Factors;Obesity,,

These changes are linked to anogenital distance (AGD), which is an androgen-sensitive anthropometric parameter used as a biomarker of perineal growth and caudal migration of the genital tubercle. This review aimed to summarize strength of evidence for associations of in utero exposure to EDCs with AGD and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature so as to inform future research. We performed an electronic search of English literature in September 2019 in medical literature analysis and retrieval system online (MEDLINE), Web of Science and Toxline. We included epidemiological studies that examined in utero exposure to persistent and nonpersistent EDCs and considered AGD in offspring as an outcome. Our review contained 16 investigations examining exposure to persistent EDCs (nine studies) and nonpersistent EDCs (seven studies). Some individual studies reported an inverse association between exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), dioxins, perfluoroalkyl substances, and organochlorides and AGD in both male and female offspring. Meta-analysis of three studies found a small reduction of AGD in female offspring exposed to BPA. The number of studies per chemical is small, and number of subjects examined is limited; so, replication of these results is needed. To achieve more specificity and better replication of results, future studies should establish the association of nonpersistent EDCs using multiple urine samples, evaluate the cumulative impact of exposure to a mixture of anti-androgenic chemicals, and offer adequate consideration of more maternaland children-related confounding factors. Summary sentence Early-life exposure to anti-androgenic endocrine disrupting chemicals provide inconsistent findings demonstrating an inverse association between higher maternal levels of some chemicals and anogenital distance, the effect being more common in male offspring.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no OCPs",10.1093/biolre/ioz200,Humans;Male;Female;Pregnancy;Epidemiologic Studies;Anthropometry;Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects;*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects;Anal Canal/*anatomy & histology/drug effects;Endocrine Disruptors/*administration & dosage;Genitalia/*anatomy & histology/drug effects,,

In reviewing the potential human carcinogenicity of PCBs, ATSDR (1999) concluded that “The weight of evidence does not support a causal association for PCBs and human cancer at this time.” Just 1 year later, in an updated Toxicological Profile for Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), the conclusions of another analysis (ATSDR, 2000) on whether exposure to PCBs might represent a carcinogenic risk to humans had dramatically changed to “Overall, the human studies provide some evidence that PCBs are carcinogenic” and “some of these studies provide meaningful evidence that PCBs are carcinogenic in humans.” Because this is a substantially different conclusion than that reached only one year previously, it raises a number of questions that must be considered particularly since “weight of evidence” has a precise meaning in the context of evaluating a body of epidemiological data. The present review addresses the additional scientific data that became available between the ATSDR 1999 and 2000 evaluations that was of a magnitude to offset the weight of evidence from numerous epidemiological studies that exposure to PCBs was not causally associated with human cancer to a conclusion only 1 year later that there was now “meaningful evidence” that PCBs posed a carcinogenic risk to humans. Also of interest are the criteria upon which this conclusion is based and the distinction between “weight of evidence” and the newer descriptors of “some evidence” and “meaningful evidence.” However, as shown in this review, only one relevant study was published between the ATSDR 1999 and 2000 evaluations and the results of this study were unequivocally supportive of the 1999 conclusion. Because of the continuing controversy surrounding this issue, in this review, all relevant epidemiological data on PCBs are summarized and subjected to another weight of evidence evaluation. This critical review is based on the most recent guidelines (U.S. EPA, 1999a, 2003) for conducting weight-of-evidence evaluations on a body of epidemiological data. Applying a weight-of-evidence evaluation to the PCB epidemiological studies can only lead to the conclusion that there is no causal relationship between PCB exposure and any form of cancer, thereby confirming the conclusions of ATSDR (1999). Also considered is the methodology and logic used by ATSDR (2000) that resulted in overturning the weight of evidence conclusions concerning the human carcinogenicity of PCBs in ATSDR (1999). This issue may have public health and policy implications. It seems appropriate that unbiased evaluations of a body of data, even of controversial issues such as the potential human carcinogenicity of PCBs, be conducted in a transparent manner following applicable guidelines. The dramatic differences between the conclusions of ATSDR (1999) and ATSDR (2000) do not appear to be consistent with this process.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",10.1080/10408440390242414,Humans;Humanism;Humanities,,

Countries with rapidly developing economies such as China are faced with significant soil pollution problems due to accelerated industrialization and urbanization over the last decades. This paper provides an overview of published scientific data on soil pollution across China with particular focus on organic contamination in agricultural soils. Based on the related peer-reviewed papers published since 2000 (n=203), we evaluated the priority organic contaminants across China, revealed their spatial and temporal distributions at the national scale, identified their possible sources and fates in soil, assessed their potential environmental risks, and presented the challenges in current remediation technologies regarding the combined organic pollution of agricultural soils. The primary pollutants in Northeast China were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) due to intensive fossil fuel combustion. The concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and phthalic acid esters (PAEs) were higher in North and Central China owing to concentrated agricultural activities. The levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were higher in East and South China primarily because of past industrial operations and improper electronic waste processing. The co-existence of organic contaminants was severe in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, which are the most populated and industrialized regions in China. Integrated biological-chemical remediation technologies, such as surfactant-enhanced bioremediation, have potential uses in the remediation of soil contaminated by multiple contaminants. This critical review highlighted several future research directions including combined pollution, interfacial interactions, food safety, bioavailability, ecological effects, and integrated remediation methods for combined organic pollution in soil.

Methods: We conducted a case-control study of PD nested in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a cohort of pesticide applicators and spouses. We evaluated diet and pesticide use before diagnosis in 89 PD cases, confirmed by movement disorder specialists, or a corresponding date in 336 frequency-matched controls. Associations were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: In the AHS, PD was inversely associated with N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8 for highest vs. lowest tertile) and the N-3 precursor α-linolenic acid (0.4, 0.2-0.8). In a meta-analysis of nine studies, including the present one, PD was inversely associated with α-linolenic acid (0.81, 0.68-0.96). In the AHS, associations of PD with the pesticides paraquat and rotenone were modified by fat intake. The OR for paraquat was 4.2 (1.5-12) in individuals with PUFA intake below the median but 1.2 (0.4-3.4) in those with higher intake (p-interaction=0.10). The OR for rotenone was 5.8 (2.3-15) in those with saturated fat intake above the median but 1.5 (0.5-4.2) in those with lower intake (p-interaction=0.02). Conclusions: PUFA intake was consistently associated with lower PD risk, and dietary fats modified the association of PD risk with pesticide exposure. If confirmed, these findings suggest that a diet high in PUFAs and low in saturated fats might reduce risk of PD. © 2013.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not organochlorine pesticide | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no OCPs",10.1016/j.parkreldis.2013.09.023,Pesticides;Parkinson Disease;Dietary Fats,,

RESULTS: Many studies have found an association between pesticides and PD, but no one agent has been consistently identified. Those implicated include organochlorine insecticides, maneb and paraquat. One meta-analysis of pesticide exposure and PD found an almost doubling of risk in those exposed. Associations with specific agents may be confounded by exposure to other pesticides, making it difficult to identify the causative agent.

This review will highlight the effects of organochlorine (for e.g. endosulfan) and organophosphate (for e.g. malathion) pesticides in comparison with sex-steroid analogue-induced changes on HHG axis during gametogenesis in few teleost fish models. Interestingly, the effects of these compounds have produced differential effects in juveniles and adults which also vary based on exposure dosage and duration. Further, the treatments had caused at times sexually dimorphic effects indicating that the action of these compounds bring out serious implications in sexual development. A comprehensive overview has been provided by considering all these aspects to recognize the adverse impacts of pesticide-induced endocrine disruption with special reference to endosulfan and malathion as those had been applied even today or used before for controlling agricultural pests in several Asian countries including India. This review also compares the effects of sex-steroid analogues where in sex reversal to reproductive dysfunction is evident, which may imply the extent of sexual plasticity in teleosts compared to other vertebrates.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",,Humans;Pesticides;Animals;Adult;Adolescent;Gonads;Endocrine Disruptors/*pharmacology;Fishes/*physiology;Androgens/pharmacology;Endocrine System/*drug effects;Endosulfan/pharmacology;Estrogens/pharmacology;Gametogenesis/*drug effects;Gonads/*drug effects;Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*drug effects;Pesticides/pharmacology,,

Living near agricultural pesticide applications and the risk of adverse reproductive outcomes: a review of the literature. Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology 2010. Over the last decade, there has been growing concern about the possible health effects, including a number of adverse reproductive outcomes, from pesticide exposure of people living near agricultural fields. This systematic review evaluates the current epidemiological evidence on the association between living near agricultural pesticide applications and adverse reproductive outcomes, including congenital malformations, stillbirth, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), low birthweight, preterm birth and miscarriage. We identified and reviewed 25 studies from a systematic search of the main scientific databases and other sources published in 1950-2007. Study methods and main results were summarised and tabulated according to the year of study, design and type of adverse reproductive outcome. The levels of evidence for reproductive toxicity in humans contributed by each study were assessed and the main limitations associated with these studies discussed. Residential proximity to agricultural pesticide applications may be an important source of ambient environmental exposure, but because of the underlying methodological difficulties, the strength of evidence for its relationship with adverse reproductive outcomes is generally weak and varied between outcomes. The evidence suggested an association for congenital malformations, but because of methodological limitations, such as poor exposure measurement and potentially inadequate control of confounding, a firm conclusion remains beyond reach. For the other outcomes (stillbirth, IUGR, low birthweight, preterm birth and miscarriage) the evidence for any associations was equivocal at best, but some leads warrant further investigation. Improved exposure assessment methods are needed to obtain a more reliable assessment of any risks.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: full text not availabe",10.1111/j.1365-3016.2010.01165.x,Pesticides,,

The endocrine system is most vulnerable to assaults by endocrine disruptors during the prenatal and early development window, and effects may persist into adulthood and across generations. The prenatal stage is a period of vulnerability to environmental chemicals because the epigenome is usually reprogrammed during this period. Bisphenol A (BPA), lead (Pb), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) were chosen for critical review because they have become serious public health concerns globally, especially in Africa where they are widely used without any regulation. In this review, we introduce EDCs and describe the various modes of action of EDCs and the importance of the prenatal and developmental windows to EDC exposure. We give a brief overview of epigenetics and describe the various epigenetic mechanisms: DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, and how each of them affects gene expression. We then summarize findings from previous studies on the effects of prenatal exposure to the endocrine disruptors BPA, Pb and DDT on each of the previously described epigenetic mechanisms. We also discuss how the epigenetic alterations caused by these EDCs may be related to disease processes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",10.1515/reveh-2018-0059,Epigenomics,,

Synthetically produced environmental chemicals (endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs)) mimic hormones like oestrogen and alter signalling pathways. Endometriosis is an oestrogen-dependent condition, affecting 10-15% of women of the reproductive age, and has substantial impacts on the quality of life. The aetiology of endometriosis is believed to be multifactorial, ranging from genetic causes to immunologic dysfunction due to environmental exposure to EDCs. Hence, we undertook a systematic review and investigated the epidemiological evidence for an association between EDCs and the development of endometriosis. We also aimed to assess studies on the relationship between body concentration of EDCs and the severity of endometriosis. METHOD: Following PRISMA guidelines, a structured search of PubMed, Embase and Scopus was conducted (to July 2018). The included studies analysed the association between one or more EDCs and the prevalence of endometriosis. The types of EDCs, association and outcome, participant characteristics and confounding variables were extracted and analysed. Quality assessment was performed using standard criteria. RESULTS: In total, 29 studies were included. Phthalate esters were positively associated with the prevalence of endometriosis. The majority (71%) of studies revealed a significant association between bisphenol A, organochlorinated environmental pollutants (dioxins, dioxin-like compounds, organochlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls) and the prevalence of endometriosis. A positive association between copper, chromium and prevalence of endometriosis was demonstrated in one study only. Cadmium, lead and mercury were not associated with the prevalence of endometriosis. There were conflicting results for the association between nickel and endometriosis. The relationship of EDCs and severity of endometriosis was not established in the studies. CONCLUSION: We found some evidence to suggest an association between phthalate esters, bisphenol A, organochlorinated environmental pollutants and the prevalence of endometriosis. Disentangling these exposures from various other factors that affect endometriosis is complex, but an important topic for further research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",,Humans;Female;Middle Aged;Adult;Aged;Endometriosis;Environmental Exposure;Prevalence;Young Adult;Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects;Endocrine Disruptors/*adverse effects;Environmental Pollutants/*adverse effects;Endometriosis/chemically induced/*epidemiology/pathology,,

Medline, PubMed and EBSCO searches were performed to identify the studies that analyzed the association of prenatal and postnatal child exposure to such toxicants and ADHD or ADHD-related symptoms. The review is restricted to human studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals since 2000. Most of the presented studies focused on pesticides, PCB and lead. The impact of mercury and manganese was investigated less frequently. The findings indicate that children's exposure to organophosphate pesticides may cause symptoms consistent with pervasive developmental disorder, ADHD or attention problems. Exposures to organochlorine pesticides and PCBs were associated with ADHD-like behaviors such as alertness, quality of alert response, and cost of attention. The studies provided evidence that blood lead level below 10 mu g/dl was associated with ADHD or ADHD-related symptoms. Information on the association between exposure to mercury and neurotoxicity is limited, and requires further confirmation in future research. Two studies indicated that exposure to manganese is related to ADHD; such exposure and its impact on children neurodevelopment need to be further investigated. Future studies should use a prospective design with multiple biological samples collected over time for better assessment of exposure and its critical windows. Additionally, inclusion of potential confounding factors and co-exposures is crucial.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",10.2478/s13382-013-0073-7,Pesticides;Child;Only Child,,

Breast cancer's long latency and multifactorial etiology make evaluation of these chemicals in humans challenging. Objective: For chemicals previously identified as mammary gland toxicants, we evaluated epidemiologic studies published since our 2007 review. We assessed whether study designs captured relevant exposures and disease features suggested by toxicological and biological evidence of genotoxicity, endocrine disruption, tumor promotion, or disruption of mammary gland development. Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed database for articles with breast cancer outcomes published in 2006-2016 using terms for 134 environmental chemicals, sources, or biomarkers of exposure. We critically reviewed the articles. Results: We identified 158 articles. Consistent with experimental evidence, a few key studies suggested higher risk for exposures during breast development to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dioxins, perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA), and air pollution (risk estimates ranged from 2.14 to 5.0), and for occupational exposure to solvents and other mammary carcinogens, such as gasoline components (risk estimates ranged from 1.42 to 3.31). Notably, one 50-year cohort study captured exposure to DDT during several critical windows for breast development (in utero, adolescence, pregnancy) and when this chemical was still in use. Most other studies did not assess exposure during a biologically relevant window or specify the timing of exposure. Few studies considered genetic variation, but the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project reported higher breast cancer risk for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in women with certain genetic variations, especially in DNA repair genes. Conclusions: New studies that targeted toxicologically relevant chemicals and captured biological hypotheses about genetic variants or windows of breast susceptibility added to evidence of links between environmental chemicals and breast cancer. However, many biologically relevant chemicals, including current-use consumer product chemicals, have not been adequately studied in humans. Studies are challenged to reconstruct exposures that occurred decades before diagnosis or access biological samples stored that long. Other problems include measuring rapidly metabolized chemicals and evaluating exposure to mixtures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.045,Breast Neoplasms,,

With the re-emergence of schistosomiasis, the warranted production and consumption of PCP has inevitably resulted in persistent environmental contamination by it and its impurities, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). This study aimed to evaluate the contamination status and human burden of PCP and its impurities (PCDD/Fs) in China, considering the previous epidemic and re-emergence of schistosomiasis. We searched studies relevant to PCP occurrence in the environment and in humans in China. Data on snail elimination areas were included to estimate PCP consumption. Relevant publications were analyzed to distinguish PCDD/Fs contamination from PCP usage. PCP contamination was detected ubiquitously in various environmental media and in human samples; environmental levels were generally low, with the exception of some hot spots. In schistosomiasis-epidemic areas, there were significantly higher PCP levels in the environment and in humans than in control areas. Spatial disparities indicated the consistency between serious schistosomiasis epidemic areas and hot spots of PCP contamination. The data suggest an increased trend in PCP contamination of the environment. Specific PCDD/Fs contamination from PCP usage existed even at low environmental levels. The occurrence of PCP in the environment and in humans positively correlated with the epidemic of schistosomiasis. Thyroid-disrupting effects and cancer risk caused by PCP and PCDD/Fs even at low environmental levels in China's schistosomiasis-epidemic areas are of concern.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",,Humans;Animals;China;Environment;Risk Assessment;Humanism;Humanities;Schistosomiasis;Aquatic Organisms/metabolism;Environmental Exposure/statistics & numerical data;Environmental Pollutants/*analysis/metabolism;Environmental Pollution/statistics & numerical data;Molluscacides/*analysis/metabolism;Neoplasms/epidemiology;Pentachlorophenol/*analysis/metabolism;Schistosomiasis/*epidemiology/prevention & control,,

As part of the global efforts to control malaria, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), a cheap and effective chemical, was endorsed by the World Health Organization for use in indoor residual spraying (IRS). However, in the light of evidence on the acute toxicity of DDT, concerns have grown about the safety or the possible chronic health effects from the continued use of this persistent chemical, generating much debate and research efforts over the years. The purpose of this study was to identify, appraise and synthesise evidence about the chronic adverse effects of long-term exposure to DDT in children, 0-18 years, in zones where IRS is practised, in order to contribute to informing policy decisions. METHODS: Twenty-seven electronic databases were systematically searched using pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Two were trial registers while 25 others indexed studies of various designs. Other complementary methods were also employed in searching for both published and grey literature. Eligible studies were critically appraised using amended versions of available validated guidelines (and in a case, an improvised guideline) and a narrative synthesis was undertaken. RESULTS: Only nine studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria out of 3281 hits generated. Five of the studies are of high quality while four are of moderate quality. For the three studies on neurodevelopment, evidence suggestive of negative impact of DDT was found. For the three studies on endocrine/congenital disorders, ambivalent evidence existed. In the case of the immunity-related outcome, there was growing but insufficient evidence of negative effect. The only study on survival outcome was inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Empirically, insufficient evidence exists with regard to the chronic adverse effects of long-term exposure of children to DDT through IRS. Considering the dearth of studies and the fact that many adverse effects might take much longer time to manifest, inferences drawn are weak. It would therefore require a series of well-coordinated observational studies done in the context of IRS to adequately address this evidence gap in the future.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",,Humans;Infant;Newborn;Child;Preschool;Insecticides;Databases;Environmental Health;Immunity;Adolescent;Active;Factual;Registries;*Environmental Exposure;DDT/*adverse effects/toxicity;Mosquito Control/*methods;Pesticide Residues/toxicity;Only Child,,

Since then, it has been measured in different ethnic populations and its utility in various medical conditions have been explored. We aimed to review the literature regarding the various values reported analytically. METHOD: A Pubmed Search was carried out with the terms Anal Position Index. There were 158 articles hit by the search. The description of the API was uniform in all studies, described as ratio of anus-fourchette distance in girls and anus-scrotum distance in boys to the distance between coccyx and fourchette/scrotum. 18 relevant studies were included describing the values in different ethnic groups and describing its utility. One study was excluded from statistics due to different landmark for measurement. The studies were grouped into 4. Group A:B:C:D comprised of Newborns:Infants:All age groups:Constipated children. We carried out meta-analysis to estimate effect size (mean difference) using STATA software version 16.0. RESULTS: The different ethnic populations in which API were measured, and were Indian (2), Turkish (3), Israel (2), Taiwanese, Thai, Iranian, Spanish, Italian, and Mexican. The API was higher by 0.129 in boys. The mean API in males was 0.53:0.54:0.48:0.52 in Group A:B:C:D with an overall mean (SD) API of 0.51 (0.04). The mean API in females was 0.40:0.40:0.38:0.37 in Group A:B:C:D with an overall mean (SD) API of 0.40(0.03). Two studies were done in mice and showed the relation of API to intrauterine exposure to androgens. In children, API was mostly used to diagnose an anterior ectopic anus and see correlation with constipation. The abnormal values varied from less than 0.30-0.34 in girls and less than 0.41-0.46 in boys. The effect size by regions showed that the estimated effect size for all the regions were within 95% Confidence limits of overall estimate (0.13: 95% CI: 0.13-0.14). Therefore, it can be inferred that there was no significant ethnic variation in the study parameter. The anal position in relation to genitalia was measured in nulliparous women, menopause women, and women with levator deficiency. It was affected in vulvovaginal atrophy. Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy was reported to alter the anal position in male infants. CONCLUSION: The anteriorly positioned anus has been associated with constipation. API been measured in various ethnic populations with insignificant variations. The API is significantly (p < 0.05) higher in males. The presence of constipation does not seem to alter API. One should adopt a single method for measurement. API should not be considered at the sole indication for any surgical intervention.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis on organochlorine pesticide | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no OCPs",,Humans;Male;Animals;Female;Infant;Newborn;Spain;Mice;Genitalia;Mexico;Thailand;Iran;Coccyx;Constipation;Israel;Italy;Scrotum;Turkey;*Anal Canal;*Anorectal Malformations,,

A systematic review of the literature was conducted to clarify, starting from environmental exposure data, whether possible occupational risk factors may correlate with the onset of the disease. The guidelines for reporting systematic reviews of the ""PRISMA"" statement were followed and two databases, Scopus and PubMed, were used. Of the 422 studies selected with specific keywords, 32 publications were eligible, 28 of which referred to chemical agents and 4 related to night work. Conflicting data emerged among these studies. Although some compounds seemed to be more involved than others in the onset of endometriosis. Association with exposure to organochlorine compounds is the most supported by the epidemiological data, while other pesticide exposure did not show any clear correlation. Likewise, the hypothesis of a correlation with perfluoroalkyls exposure is not currently supported by data. The involvement of metals as risk factors has not been confirmed, while the role of night work, in the case of long service, seems to play an etiological role. In order to clarify the potential occupational risk of endometriosis development, well-designed studies are needed to evaluate the potential association between chemical compounds and disease etiology.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",,Chlorinated;Humans;Female;Environmental Exposure;Risk Factors;Occupational Exposure;*Occupational Exposure/adverse effects;*Pesticides/toxicity;*Endometriosis/chemically induced/epidemiology;*Hydrocarbons,,

Their potential risks on reproduction and infants are still unknown. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether infant's birth weight and length of gestation were associated with levels of various pesticides in maternal blood based on Nanjing Medical University (NMU) affiliated hospitals data and meta-analysis, and also to explore the possible intermediate metabolomics pathways. METHODS: Eligible subjects (n = 102) were included in this study from the affiliated hospitals of NMU. Gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (QE) were used to detect 37 pesticides (9 organophosphorus pesticides, 7 organochlorine pesticides, 5 carbamate pesticides, and 16 others) and 161 metabolites (53 in animo acid metabolism 47 in lipid metabolism, 18 in carbohydrate metabolism, 14 in nucleotide metabolism and 29 in other metabolisms) in maternal blood, respectively. Multi-linear regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were performed to identify the association of single/mixed pesticide exposure in maternal blood with birth weight and length of gestation. Moreover, we conducted a meta-analysis including additional 2497 subjects to evaluate whether exposure to key pesticide, β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH) was associated with decreased birth weight globally. Mediation analysis was used to explore the metabolic alteration mediating the association between key pesticide exposure and birth outcomes. RESULTS: We found that decreased birth weight was significantly associated with increasing levels of mecarbam and β-HCH. We did not find any association between length of gestation and these pesticides. Among pesticides with detection rate more than 50%, BKMR analysis found an overall negative association of mixed pesticides exposure with birth weight, and verified that β-HCH was the key pesticide for such effect. Meta-analysis revealed a significantly negative association between exposure to β-HCH and birth weight. Metabolomics identified three metabolites and five metabolites as significant mediators for the effect of mecarbam and β-HCH, respectively, among which glyceraldehyde and its related glycerolipid metabolism and thyroxine and its related thyroid hormone metabolism were found to be the mostly enriched mediating metabolic pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the comprehensive pesticide exposome and metabolome wide associational study combined with meta-analysis, we found that prenatal exposure to β-HCH and mecarbam decreased birth weight via disrupting thyroid hormone metabolism and glyceraldehyde metabolism, providing new insights into the toxic effects of exposure to pesticides on birth outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",,Humans;Pesticides;China;Female;Pregnancy;Bayes Theorem;Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry;*Pesticides/toxicity;*Birth Weight;*Exposome;*Maternal Exposure;*Metabolomics;*Pregnancy Outcome;Thyroid Hormones/metabolism,,

Further, this review aims to estimate the risk quotient using the data extracted from these studies and compare it with the values from current legislation. The studies on pesticides were selected and screened, out of which 21 scientific articles were included in this review. The studies highlighted that 55 pesticides were detected in the soils in Brazil. Of these, 58% belonged to the chemical class of organochlorines and their concentration ranged from 0.0002-1243.68 mg kg-1. DDT (0.00002-1243.68 mg kg-1), HCH (0.00007-962.00 mg kg-1) and diuron (0.0031-4.16 mg kg-1) contributed to highest pesticide concentrations in soil. Residential soils had higher pesticide concentrations and greater risk factors than the agricultural soils. Moreover, 20% of the studies detected mixtures containing more than 10 types of pesticides.

If chemical toxicity to most saltwater organisms increases with water temperature, the use of temperate species data and associated WQG may result in under-protection to tropical species. Given the differences in species composition and environmental attributes between tropical and temperate saltwater ecosystems, there are conceivable uncertainties in such 'temperate-to-tropic' extrapolations. This study aims to compare temperate and tropical saltwater species' acute sensitivity to 11 chemicals through a comprehensive meta-analysis, by comparing species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) between the two groups. A 10 percentile hazardous concentration (HC10) is derived from each SSD, and then a temperate-to-tropic HC10 ratio is computed for each chemical. Our results demonstrate that temperate and tropical saltwater species display significantly different sensitivity towards all test chemicals except cadmium, although such differences are small with the HC10 ratios ranging from 0.094 (un-ionised ammonia) to 2.190 (pentachlorophenol) only. Temperate species are more sensitive to un-ionised ammonia, chromium, lead, nickel and tributyltin, whereas tropical species are more sensitive to copper, mercury, zinc, phenol and pentachlorophenol. Through comparison of a limited number of taxon-specific SSDs, we observe that there is a general decline in chemical sensitivity from algae to crustaceans, molluscs and then fishes. Following a statistical analysis of the results, we recommend an extrapolation factor of two for deriving tropical WQG from temperate information.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not conventional meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",,Animals;Water Pollutants;Metals;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Climate;Fishes;Invertebrates;Plants;Salinity;Species Specificity;Seawater/chemistry;Ammonia/toxicity;Pentachlorophenol/toxicity;Phenol/toxicity;Trialkyltin Compounds/toxicity;Chemical/*toxicity;Heavy/toxicity,,

However, there are limited data about the other pesticide groups, especially in Europe. OBJECTIVES: Based on a systematic review, we aimed to assess the influence of neuro- and thyrotoxic agricultural and domestic pesticides (other than OPs, OCs, pyrethroids and carbamates) authorized in Europe on risk of ASD in children or ASD behavioral phenotypes in rodents. METHODS: Pesticides were initially identified in the Hazardous Substances Data Bank. 20 currently used (10 pesticide groups) were retained based on the higher exposure potential. Epidemiological (children) and in vivo (rodents) studies were identified through PubMed, Web of Science and TOXLINE, without restriction of publication date or country (last update: November 2019). The risk of bias and level of evidence were also assessed. This systematic review is registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, registration number CRD42019145384). RESULTS: In total, two epidemiological and 15 in vivo studies were retained, focusing on the azole, neonicotinoid, phenylpyrazole and phosphonoglycine pesticide groups. No study was conducted in Europe. Glyphosate, imidacloprid, clothianidin, myclobutanil, acetamiprid, tebuconazole, thiabendazole and fipronil, globally reported an association with an increased risk of ASD in children and/or ASD behavioral phenotypes in rodents. In children, glyphosate and myclobutanil showed a ""moderate level of evidence"" in their association with ASD, whereas imidacloprid showed an ""inadequate level of evidence"". In rodents, clothianidin, imidacloprid and glyphosate showed a ""high level of evidence"" in their association with altered behavioral, learning and memory skills. CONCLUSION: In the framework of environmental risk factors of ASD, novel hypotheses can be formulated about early exposure to eight pesticides. Glyphosate presented the most salient level of evidence. Given their neuro- and thyrotoxic properties, additional studies are needed for the 12 other pesticides not yet studied as potential ASD risk factors according to our inclusion criteria.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",,"Humans;Pesticides;Europe;Child;Carbamates;Autistic Disorder;*Pesticides/toxicity;Europe/epidemiology;*Autism Spectrum Disorder/epidemiology;*Pyrethrins/toxicity;Carbamates/toxicity;Organophosphates/toxicity;Child Development Disorders;Pervasive;Child Development Disorders, Pervasive",,

The purpose of this review is to examine the existing literature on perinatal and environmental risk factors for Wilms' tumour. A search for epidemiological studies that examined risk factors for Wilms' tumour was undertaken in Medline, LILACS, ISI Web of Science and Dissertation Abstracts. A total of 37 studies, including 14 cohort, 21 case-control and 2 case-cohort studies, were identified that examined environmental and perinatal risk factors. Most studies were from Western Europe and North America, and among case-control studies, 16 used randomly selected population-based controls. We observed a significantly increased risk of Wilms' tumour with maternal exposure to pesticides prior to the child's birth (OR = 1.37 [95% CI 1.09, 1.73]), high birthweight (OR = 1.36 [95% CI 1.12, 1.64]) and preterm birth (OR = 1.44 [95% CI 1.14, 1.81]), although the results regarding pesticide exposure may be subject to publication bias (Egger's test, P = 0.09).

However, the environmental exposure and impact of pesticides in Pakistan have yet been systematically reviewed, despite the country's leading role in pesticide use. Therefore, this study identified and then reviewed 85 peer-reviewed scientific publications on the topic. It was found that, compared to the worldwide average, Pakistan had high consumptions of pesticides, with an alarming increase of 1169% in the last two decades. The quantities of pesticides used followed an order of pyrethroids > organophosphates > organochlorines > carbamates, but organochlorines were the most problematic due to their environmental occurrence, the ability to transport across the media, and identified human and ecological toxicities. Additionally, the misuse or overuse of pesticides by farmers is prevailing due to insufficient knowledge about the risks, which leads to high risks in occupational exposure. These issues are further aggravated by the illegal use or continuous impacts of banned organochlorine pesticides. For the future, we suggested the establishment of organized monitoring, assessment, and reporting program based on environmental laws to minimize contamination and exposure to pesticides in Pakistan. Remediation of the contaminated areas to mitigate the adverse environmental-cum-health impacts are recommended in the most affected regions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",10.1007/s11356-022-20164-7,Pesticides;Pakistan,,

We conducted a systematic review focusing on: 1) processes of POP maternal transfer, 2) challenges and opportunities to synthesizing current knowledge on POP concentrations in eggs, and 3) a meta-analysis of patterns in current egg pollution data. Results suggest selective maternal transfer of individual compounds. These relate to biological factors such as the foraging and remigration behavior, and to the selective mobilization of POPs during vitellogenesis, such as increased diffusion limitation for lipophilic POPs and slower release and higher reabsorption of apolar POPs. A key gap relates to knowledge of further selective toxicokinetics during embryonic development, as research to date has mainly focused on initial uptake into eggs. Challenges in the synthesis of current data on egg contamination profiles relate to methodological differences, varying analytical approaches, restricted data access, and reporting transparency among studies. To increase opportunities in the use of current data, we propose best practice guidelines, and synthesize a database on POP concentrations within sea turtle eggs. The meta-analysis revealed a geographical and taxonomic bias on the West Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, with most studies conducted on green turtles. Concentrations of POPs show temporal patterns related to trends in usage, production, release, and persistence in the environment, often with regional patterns. The trophic level has the potential to influence POP patterns with higher concentrations in loggerheads compared to other species, but this is confounded by temporal and geographic trends. We argue for more mechanistically process-focused and methodologically comparable research.

While emerging contaminants form the focus of increasing numbers of publications since 2006, they are understudied compared to more traditionally-measured contaminants (here, DDT and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs). BisphenolA was the most widely studied of the emerging contaminants (n = 41 studies) in the GBA, followed by macrolides (n = 32 studies). While multiple point measurements with high precision and low detection limits have been reported for various emerging contaminants, these have not been integrated for management purposes. A relatively high percentage of studies present data from single deployments (48% of studies, despite strong seasonality in the PRD system), data coverage is variable spatially, and reported contaminant concentrations vary significantly (over one to four orders of magnitude). We assess the currently published knowledge under the Source-Pathway-Receptor contaminant linkage model and use this to identify (a) current research emphasis in relation to assessment of contaminant risk, and (b) key knowledge gaps around sources, pathways and receptors in the GBA system.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",10.1016/j.envsci.2022.02.002,China,,

Prior research has indicated that there may be associations between exposure to pesticides of a variety of classes and decreased sperm health. The intent of this review was to summarize the most recent evidence related to pesticide exposures and commonly used semen quality parameters, including concentration, motility and morphology. The recent literature was searched for studies published between January 2007 and August 2012 that focused on environmental or occupational pesticide exposures. Included in the review are 17 studies, 15 of which reported significant associations between exposure to pesticides and semen quality indicators. Two studies also investigated the roles genetic polymorphisms may play in the strength or directions of these associations. Specific pesticides targeted for study included dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), and abamectin. Pyrethroids and organophosphates were analyzed as classes of pesticides rather than as individual compounds, primarily due to the limitations of exposure assessment techniques. Overall, a majority of the studies reported significant associations between pesticide exposure and sperm parameters. A decrease in sperm concentration was the most commonly reported finding among all of the pesticide classes investigated. Decreased motility was also associated with exposures to each of the pesticide classes, although these findings were less frequent across studies. An association between pesticide exposure and sperm morphology was less clear, with only two studies reporting an association. The evidence presented in this review continues to support the hypothesis that exposures to pesticides at environmentally or occupationally relevant levels may be associated with decreased sperm health. Future work in this area should focus on associations between specific pesticides or metabolic products and sperm quality parameters. Analysis of effects of varying genetic characteristics, especially in genes related to pesticide metabolism, also needs further attention.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",,Humans;Hydrocarbons;Male;Pesticides;Humanism;Humanities;Semen Analysis;Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects;Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects;Organophosphates/adverse effects;Pesticides/*adverse effects;Pyrethrins/adverse effects;Spermatozoa/*drug effects;Chlorinated/adverse effects,,

Although overexploitation and habitat degradation are the two biggest threats to batoid populations, coastal and oceanic pollution is also a pervasive potential threat. In this systematic review, we compile published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea superorder and present contamination patterns, exposure effects, and potential human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found batoids to accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Accumulation of POPs is reported for chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Hg levels in muscle tissue were significantly different among oceanic basins and habitats, consistent with previous global assessments of Hg oceanic background levels. Some batoid species presented Hg levels higher than large pelagic teleost fishes and comparable to sharks. Ecological traits such as, bottom feeding, upper trophic position and elasmobranch-specific physiology and metabolism are discussed as potential factors associated with Hg uptake and accumulation in batoids. Some species exceeded USEPA's maximum contamination safety limits in edible tissues for Hg, As and ΣPCBs. For most trace metals and POPs, there is a lack of studies focusing on contamination levels in batoids. We recommend future research increasing reporting on POPs and trace metals besides Hg in batoids to further investigate the role of Elasmobranch as a bioindicator for marine pollution.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not meta analysis | USER-NOTES: {""Lorenzo""=>[""stats on Hg.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to systematically review the experimental evidence (in vivo and in vitro) on the associations between exposure to OCCs and endometriosis-related end points. METHODS: A systematic review protocol was developed following the National Toxicology Program /Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP/OHAT) framework and managed within a web-based interface. In vivo studies designed to evaluate the impact of OCCs on the onset or progression of endometriosis and proliferation of induced endometriotic lesions were eligible. Eligible in vitro studies included single-cell and co-culture models to evaluate the proliferation, migration, and/or invasion of endometrial cells. We applied the search strings to PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus®. A final search was performed on 24 June 2020. Assessment of risk of bias and the level of evidence and integration of preevaluated epidemiological evidence was conducted using NTP/OHAT framework Results: Out of 812 total studies, 39 met the predetermined eligibility criteria (15 in vivo, 23 in vitro, and 1 both). Most studies (n = 27) tested TCDD and other dioxin-like chemicals. In vivo evidence supported TCDD's promotion of endometriosis onset and lesion growth. In vitro evidence supported TCDD's promotion of cell migration and invasion, but there was insufficient evidence for cell proliferation. In vitro evidence further supported the roles of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and matrix metalloproteinases in mediating steroidogenic disruption and inflammatory responses. Estrogen interactions were found across studies and end points. CONCLUSION: Based on the integration of a high level of animal evidence with a moderate level of epidemiological evidence, we concluded that TCDD was a known hazard for endometriosis in humans and the conclusion is supported by mechanistic in vitro evidence. Nonetheless, there is need for further research to fill in our gaps in understanding of the relationship between OCCs and their mixtures and endometriosis, beyond the prototypical TCDD. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8421.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",,Humans;Hydrocarbons;Animals;Female;Endometriosis;Cell Proliferation;Cell Culture Techniques;Environmental Exposure/adverse effects;*Dioxins/toxicity;*Endometriosis/chemically induced/epidemiology;*Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins/toxicity;Chlorinated/*toxicity,,

We performed an umbrella review of meta-analyses to summarize available epidemiologic evidence and assess its credibility. Methods: We systematically identified and appraised meta-analyses of observational studies examining environmental factors and risk of IBD (Crohn's disease [CD] or ulcerative colitis [UC]). For each meta-analysis, we considered the random effects estimate, its 95% confidence interval, the estimates of heterogeneity, and small-study effects, and we graded the evidence according to prespecified criteria. Methodologic quality was assessed with AMSTAR (ie, A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) 2. Results: We examined 183 estimates in 53 meta-analyses of 71 environmental factors related to lifestyles and hygiene, surgeries, drug exposures, diet, microorganisms, and vaccinations. We identified 9 factors that increase risk of IBD: smoking (CD), urban living (CD and IBD), appendectomy (CD), tonsillectomy (CD), antibiotic exposure (IBD), oral contraceptive use (IBD), consumption of soft drinks (UC), vitamin D deficiency (IBD), and non–Helicobacter pylori–like enterohepatic Helicobacter species (IBD). We identified 7 factors that reduce risk of IBD: physical activity (CD), breastfeeding (IBD), bed sharing (CD), tea consumption (UC), high levels of folate (IBD), high levels of vitamin D (CD), and H pylori infection (CD, UC, and IBD). Epidemiologic evidence for all of these associations was of high to moderate strength; we identified another 11 factors associated with increased risk and 16 factors associated with reduced risk with weak credibility. Methodologic quality varied considerably among meta-analyses. Several associations were based on findings from retrospective studies, so it is not possible to determine if these are effects of IBD or the results of recall bias. Conclusions: In an umbrella review of meta-analyses, we found varying levels of evidence for associations of different environmental factors with risk of IBD. High-quality prospective studies with analyses of samples from patients with recent diagnoses of IBD are needed to determine whether these factors cause or are results of IBD and their pathogenic mechanisms. © 2019 AGA Institute","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: umbrella review | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: umbrella review,not organochlorine pesticide | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",10.1053/j.gastro.2019.04.016,Risk Factors;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,,

Methods We used the CRA framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or groups of risks from 1990 to 2017. This study included 476 risk-outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from 46 749 randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We explored the relationship between development and risk exposure by modelling the relationship between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and risk-weighted exposure prevalence and estimated expected levels of exposure and risk-attributable burden by SDI. Finally, we explored temporal changes in risk-attributable DALYs by decomposing those changes into six main component drivers of change as follows: (1) population growth; (2) changes in population age structures; (3) changes in exposure to environmental and occupational risks; (4) changes in exposure to behavioural risks; (5) changes in exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes due to all other factors, approximated as the risk-deleted death and DALY rates, where the risk-deleted rate is the rate that would be observed had we reduced the exposure levels to the TMREL for all risk factors included in GBD 2017. © 2018 The Author(s).

Among all studied POPs, the concentration of p,p'-DDT in water resources was the highest, especially in drinking water resources. The overall rank order based on the concentration and prevalence of POPs were surface water > drinking water > seawater > groundwater. To identify POPs-contaminated areas, the distance from the mean relative to their distribution was considered. The most to the least polluted areas included: South Africa, India, Turkey, Pakistan, Canada, Hong Kong, and China. The highest carcinogenic risk was observed for β-HCH (Turkey and China), followed by α-HCH (Mexico). The highest non-carcinogenic risk was identified for Aldrin (all analyzed countries), followed by Dieldrin (Turkey) and γ-HCH (Mexico). The Monte Carlo analysis (under the assumption that γ-HCH has a normal distribution), the mean obtained was 8.22E-07 for children and 3.83E-07 for adults.

Their presence in the aquatic environment is a worldwide problem, with emphasis on sediments which act as depository and consequently as a source of hydrophobic, recalcitrant and harmful compounds. Besides, these pollutants might affect the reproduction and mortality of living organisms, diverging in their potential to bioaccumulate in tissues. The present paper aims to review the occurrence of POPs in sediments and biota from the coastal, estuarine and river areas of Portugal. The list of the studied compounds comprises organohalogenated compounds, PAHs, organometallic compounds, pesticides, sterols, fatty acids and pharmaceutical compounds. The contamination of sediments by various pollutants is presented, such as PAHs up to 7,350 ng g(-1) found in Sado estuary and polychlorinated biphenyls up to 62.2 ng g(-1) in the case of sediments collected in Ria de Aveiro. The occurrence of these persistent toxic substances in sediments demonstrates aquatic contamination from agricultural, industrial and urban discharges and the concern about the potential risks to aquatic organisms, wildlife and humans. In fact, several classes of POPs have also been found in biota, such as polychlorinated biphenyls up to 810.9 ng g(-1) in sentinel fish from the Douro River estuary and pesticides in bivalves from the Sado River estuary. The importance of further systematic research on sediments and biota is here highlighted to compare the contamination of these two reservoirs; to assess their spatial and temporal variation; and to determine other classes of POPs that were not investigated yet (e.g., industrial compounds, estrogens and many classes of pharmaceuticals).","<p>Place: England</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",10.1080/03601234.2015.1108793,Europe;Animals;Water Pollutants;Persistent organic pollutants;Fishes;Estuaries;biota;Biota;Portugal;pesticides;sediments;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis;Pesticides/analysis;Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons/analysis;Rivers/chemistry;Organic Chemicals/*analysis;Geologic Sediments/*analysis/chemistry;organohalogenated compounds;Pharmaceutical Preparations/analysis;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons;Chemical/*analysis,,

Persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substances are chemicals that can subsist for decades in human tissues and the environment. They include heavy metals, organochlorines, polychlorinated biphenyls, organobromines, organofluorines, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons among others. Although humans are often exposed to multiple pollutants simultaneously, their negative effects on health have generally been studied for each one separately. Among the most severe of these harmful effects is cancer. Here, to compile and analyze the available evidence on the relationship between exposure to mixtures of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals and the risk of developing cancer in the general population, we provide a systematic review based on the main databases (Cochrane, PubMed and Embase), together with complementary sources, using the general methodology of the PRISMA Statement. The articles analyzed were selected by two researchers working independently and their quality was evaluated by reference to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The initial search yielded 2379 results from the main sources of information and 22 from the complementary ones. After the article selection process, 22 were included in the final review (21 case-control studies and one cohort study). Analysis of the selected studies revealed that most of the mixtures analyzed were positively associated with risk of cancer, especially that of the breast, colon-rectum or testis, and more strongly so than each contaminant alone. In view of the possible stronger association observed with the development of cancer for some mixtures of pollutants than when each one is present separately, exposure to mixtures should also be monitored and measured, preferably in cohort designs, to complement the traditional approach to persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals. The results presented should be taken into account in public health policies in order to strengthen the regulatory framework for cancer prevention and control.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",,Humans;Male;Cohort Studies;Case-Control Studies;*Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology;*Environmental Pollutants/toxicity;*Polychlorinated Biphenyls,,

Therefore, it is critical to clarify clear hierarchies of evidence between types of environmental factors and CHD. Methods: Electronic searches in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane database were conducted from inception to April 20, 2020 for meta-analyses investigating the aforementioned topic. Results: Overall, 41 studies including a total of 165 meta-analyses of different environmental factors and CHD were examined, covering a wide range of risk factors. The summary random effects estimates were significant at P &lt; 0.05 in 63 meta-analyses (38%), and 15 associations (9%) were significant at P &lt; 10−6. Of these meta-analyses, eventually one risk factor (severe obesity; relative risk: 1.38, 95% confidence interval: 1.30–1.47) had significant summary associations at P &lt; 10−6, included more than 1,000 cases, had 95% prediction intervals excluding the null value, and were not suggestive of large heterogeneity (I2 &lt; 50%), small-study effects (P-value for Egger's test &gt; 0.10), or excess significance (P &gt; 0.10). Eight associations (5%) (including maternal lithium exposure, maternal obesity, maternal alcohol consumption, and maternal fever) had results that were significant at P &lt; 10−6, included more than 1,000 cases, and had 95% prediction intervals excluding the null value (highly suggestive). Conclusion: This umbrella review shows that many environmental factors have substantial evidence in relation to the risk of developing CHD.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to summarize the results of studies discussing the association between pesticides and male fertility. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed through MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Only human studies were considered. Semen parameters and DNA integrity were considered to evaluate the effect of pesticides on men. RESULTS: A total of 64 studies that investigated their impact in terms of semen parameters (51 studies) and chromatin and DNA integrity (25 studies) were included. The most frequently affected parameters were total sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm morphology, although a reduction in ejaculate volume and concentration occur in several cases. A tangible worsening of semen quality was associated with organochlorines and organophosphates. Furthermore, pesticide exposure, especially pyrethroids, was related to a higher DNA fragmentation index and chromosome aneuploidy in most articles.

Toxicity originates during the metabolization process, which may produce toxic metabolites or reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) indicate toxicants interacted with drug-metabolizing and antioxidant systems, i.e., they are biomarkers of biotransformation and oxidative stress. We meta-analytically quantified the impact of pesticides on the mean response and variability of these biomarkers. Our goals were to verify (i) the overall effect of pesticides on oxidative stress and biotransformation, and how each biomarker respond to exposure; (ii) how the life stage of fish (juvenile and adult) influence biomarkers variability and mean activity; (iii) to what extent fish sex (male, female or mixed-sex groups) modify pesticides toxicity; (iv) how different classes of pesticides, and the combination of their concentration and time of exposure, affect each biomarker. Overall, pesticides induced oxidative stress and the biotransformation system. Regardless of life stage, EROD mean activity increased significantly. In exposed juveniles, CAT and GST variability decreased and increased, respectively. CAT mean activity was higher in females, while EROD and GST activities increased in males after pesticide exposure. Organophosphorus (OPs) and organochlorine insecticides, along with imidazole and triazole fungicides, affected biomarkers the most, however the combined effect of concentration and time of exposure of OPs was not detected. Notably, imidazoles and triazoles classes increased EROD by more than 100%. Additionally, we identified research gaps, such as the lack of effect estimates of relevant pesticides on EROD (e.g., pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) and the small number of studies evaluating GSH on female fish. Future researchers may use these gaps as a guide towards enhanced experimental designs and, consequently, a better understanding of pesticide toxic effects on fish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""}",,Male;Pesticides;Animals;Antioxidants;Biotransformation;Ecosystem;Female;Oxidative Stress;*Pesticides/toxicity;Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/metabolism;Glutathione Transferase/metabolism;Catalase/metabolism;Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism;Antioxidants/metabolism;Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism;*Water Pollutants;Chemical/analysis/toxicity,,

Several consensus statements and narrative reviews in recent years have divided the scientific community and have elicited a call for systematic transparent reviews. We aimed to fill this gap in knowledge in the field of male reproductive disorders. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The aim of this study was to systematically synthesize published data on the risk of cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low sperm counts and testicular cancer following in utero or infant exposure to chemicals that have been included on the European Commission's list of Category 1 endocrine disrupting chemicals defined as having documented adverse effects due to endocrine disruption in at least one intact organism. SEARCH METHODS: A systematic literature search for original peer reviewed papers was performed in the databases PubMed and Embase to identify epidemiological studies reporting associations between the outcomes of interest and exposures documented by biochemical analyses of biospecimens including maternal blood or urine, placenta or fat tissue as well as amnion fluid, cord blood or breast milk; this was followed by meta-analysis of quantitative data. OUTCOMES: The literature search resulted in 1314 references among which we identified 33 papers(28 study populations) fulfilling the eligibility criteria. These provided 85 risk estimates of links between persistent organic pollutants and rapidly metabolized compounds (phthalates and Bisphenol A) and male reproductive disorders. The overall odds ratio (OR) across all exposures and outcomes was 1.11 (95% CI 0.91-1.35). When assessing four specific chemical subgroups with sufficient data for meta-analysis for all outcomes, we found that exposure to one of the four compounds, p,p'-DDE, was related to an elevated risk: OR 1.35 (95% CI 1.04-1.74). The data did not indicate that this increased risk was driven by any specific disorder. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The current epidemiological evidence is compatible with a small increased risk of male reproductive disorders following prenatal and postnatal exposure to some persistent environmental chemicals classified as endocrine disruptors but the evidence is limited. Future epidemiological studies may change the weight of the evidence in either direction. No evidence of distortion due to publication bias was found, but exposure-response relationships are not evident. There are insufficient data on rapidly metabolized endocrine disruptors and on specific exposure-outcome relations. A particular data gap is evident with respect to delayed effects on semen quality and testicular cancer. Although high quality epidemiological studies are still sparse, future systematic and transparent reviews may provide pieces of evidence contributing to the narrative and weight of the evidence assessments in the field.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""}",,Humans;Male;Female;Pregnancy;Risk Factors;Neoplasms;Semen Analysis;Cryptorchidism/chemically induced;Endocrine Disruptors/*toxicity;Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects;Hypospadias/chemically induced;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*epidemiology;Testicular Neoplasms/chemically induced;Xenobiotics/toxicity;Embryonal/chemically induced;Germ Cell,,

This study presents a critical review to provide updated knowledge about the fate, persistence, long-range transport and toxicity effects of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes and hexachlorocyclohexanes in the environment on the basis of analytical data between 1990 and 2014. Highest levels were found for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (200-9300 ng/L) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (20-36,000 ng/L) with mean values of 1000 and 5600 ng/L, which were 10 and 56 times higher than the European Community allowable residual limit of 100 ng/L, respectively, in Lake Taihu water of China obtained between 1999 and 2000. Levels of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes in sediments and fish species were remarkably higher than hexachlorocyclohexanes. The highest levels of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes in sediments were found up to 780-227,000 ng/g near a production factory in China and 20,000-5,463,000 ng/g in cattle dips disposal areas in Australia. Out of 32 selected locations for common fish species, tilapia had the highest mean concentration of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes up to 3800 ng/g in Noha River of Japan in 2006. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes and hexachlorocyclohexanes derive from agricultural runoff, industrial and urban wastewater, etc., that ultimately associate with soil and sediments. The carbon-carbon and carbon-chlorine bonds in dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes and hexachlorocyclohexanes provide them persistence, lipophilicity and high binding affinity leading to bioaccumulation in the receptor protein.

Methods: Medline was searched for the yea rs between 1966 and 2003, and relevant studies were identified from 1986 on. We conducted a meta-analysis of 22 studies complying with the inclusion criteria in order to pool their relative risk (RR) estimates. Studies were summarised and assessed for homogeneity and publication bias. Results: The meta-rate ratio, based on 22 estimates of RR, is 1.24 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.06-1.45]. This pooled risk estimate for the occupational categories selected is higher than the one previously calculated for farmers in general over a shorter period of publication. Substantial heterogeneity of rate ratios exists between the different studies. The major source of heterogeneity identified is geographic location. Increased meta-rate ratios are observed for studies derived from North America as well as from Europe, the meta-rate ratios from Europe being lower than those from North America. There is no obvious indication of publication bias. Conclusion: The increased meta-rate rat io for prostate cancer in agricultural pesticide applications provides additional evidence for a possible relationship between pesticide exposure and prostate cancer. The homogeneity observed between the individual rate ratios, after we had regrouped the data according to geographic location, tends to increase the consistency of the association. However, the data available from the individual studies do not provide sufficient exposure information for firm conclusions to be drawn about pesticide exposure as the cause of prostate cancer, independently from other factors. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not organochlorine,looks at location rather than pesticide type,does not distinguish pesticides into chemical classes",10.1007/s00420-004-0548-8,Pesticides;Prostatic Neoplasms;Prostatitis;Prostate;Prostatism,,
rayyan-894980472,Ovarian toxicity of environmental toxicants,2006,1,1,,18715214,6,1,,,,,,,"Ovarian production of oocytes and steroids is choreographed by hypothalamic-pituitary hormones and locally via ovarian derived growth factors and hormones. Environmental chemicals are known to mimic the actions of gonadal steroids such as estradiol or antagonize hormone actions at target tissues. The presence of environmental contaminants in ovarian follicular fluid has been documented and thus has implications for ovarian function and cancer. However, understanding of the risks to ovarian regulation resulting from exposure to environmental contaminants is limited. Therefore a systematic review of the published literature was conducted to characterize the current state of knowledge concerning the ovarian toxicity of environmental toxicants. Herein we argue that the epidemiological literature provides only weak support in favour of the involvement of environmental toxicants in adverse effects on ovarian function. By comparison animal experiments provide evidence of the biological plausibility for environmental toxicants to adversely affect ovarian physiology. Unlike environmental toxicants a strong association has been established linking cigarette smoking and ovarian toxicity. While previous in vitro studies were limited to examining the effects of test compounds on ovarian steroidogenesis, innovative culture methods are opening the door for investigation of time- and stage-dependent effects of toxicants on folliculogenesis. Although evidence of ovarian toxicity in the human population is scant, we propose that inherent limitations of the epidemiological studies together with evidence of biological plausibility provided by animal studies supports the need for further studies to better characterize the mechanism(s) of toxicant action on the ovary. © 2006 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",10.2174/187152206775528923,character(0),,

The Braak hypothesis proposes that in PD a pathologic agent may penetrate the nervous system via the olfactory bulb, gut, or both and spreads throughout the nervous system. The agent is unknown, but several environmental exposures have been associated with PD. Here, we summarize and examine the evidence for such environmental exposures. We completed a comprehensive review of human epidemiologic studies of pesticides, selected industrial compounds, and metals and their association with PD in PubMed and Google Scholar until April 2016. Most studies show that rotenone and paraquat are linked to increased PD risk and PD-like neuropathology. Organochlorines have also been linked to PD in human and laboratory studies. Organophosphates and pyrethroids have limited but suggestive human and animal data linked to PD. Iron has been found to be elevated in PD brain tissue but the pathophysiological link is unclear. PD due to manganese has not been demonstrated, though a parkinsonian syndrome associated with manganese is well-documented. Overall, the evidence linking paraquat, rotenone, and organochlorines with PD appears strong; however, organophosphates, pyrethroids, and polychlorinated biphenyls require further study.

During lactation, females can allocate energy acquired from concurrent resources (income breeding); or utilize energy stored prior to reproduction (capital breeding). Mothers transfer a large proportion of energy to their pups via lipid rich milk, meaning that pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury (Hg) will also transfer, raising concern for negative health effects. To quantify the effect of reproductive strategy on maternal pollutant transfer in pinnipeds, we developed a proxy for income and capital breeding by focusing on the lactational component of reproduction, and arranged species along this gradient. We found a strong positive relationship between lipid content in milk and degree of capital breeding. We tested this gradient against maternal pollutant transfer expressed as a concentration ratio by meta-analysis. In mother-pup pairs, the concentration ratio of PCBs was one order of magnitude higher than for mercury. PCB concentrations in pups and juveniles were similar to adult females, but mercury was always lower in young offspring than in females. We found no effect of reproductive strategy between studies investigating mother-pup pairs and non-related females and juveniles (< 1 year old), however data were strongly biased towards capital breeders. Our results suggest that either: 1) reproductive strategy does not affect pollutant bioaccumulation; or 2) a lack of income breeder data prevents us from testing the overall effect of reproductive strategy on maternal pollutant transfer. The finding that PCB concentrations in juveniles are similar to females is of concern due to early life stage exposure. We recommend data collection from income breeding species such as the sea lions to elucidate whether reproductive strategy, and potentially other life history traits, has an overall effect on maternal pollutant transfer.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not organochlorine pesticide",10.1111/oik.03955,character(0),,

Results of laboratory studies were used to establish mode of action, toxic effects, and minimum concentrations required to induce these effects by these chemicals. It appears unlikely that the more common causes of mortality, including reduced hatching, blue sac disease, and swim-up syndrome mortality in lake trout eggs were solely related to the contaminants measured in eggs and larvae. Laboratory studies suggest the concentrations required to induce increased hatching mortality and blue sac disease are much higher than levels measured in feral fish eggs. Swim-up syndrome has never been correlated with chemical exposure. Several alternate explanations relating to egg rearing conditions, nutrition, poor egg quality, and altered physiology are discussed. These factors may have interacted with the sublethal concentrations of contaminants to cause some of the observed mortality.","<p>1994 International Conference on Restoration of Lake Trout in the Laurentian Great Lakes (RESTORE), ANN ARBOR, MI, JAN 10-14, 1994</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71100-5,character(0),,

However, the harmful effects associated with such secondary emissions have yet to be thoroughly understood, especially in the spatial and temporal context, as the existing literature has a clear sampling bias with the best recognition of sites in the European Alps. In this review, we elaborated on the hazards associated with the rapid melting of glaciers releasing organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). To this end, we collated knowledge on: (1) the varying glacier melt rate across the Northern Hemisphere, (2) the content of POPs in the glacial system components, including the less represented areas, (3) the mechanisms of POPs transfer through the glacial system, including the importance of immediate emission from snow melt, (4) risk assessment associated with POPs re-emission. Based on the limited existing information, the health risk of drinking glacial water can be considered negligible, but consuming aquatic organisms from these waters may increase the risk of cancer. Remoteness from emission sources is a leading factor in the presence of such risk, yet the Arctic is likely to be more exposed to it in the future due to large-scale processes shifting atmospheric pollution and the continuous supply of snow. For future risk monitoring, we recommend to explore the synergistic toxic effects of multiple contaminants and fill the gaps in the spatial distribution of data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",,Freezing,,

They are released into the environment from flame retardants and products containing plasticizers. Persistent pesticides, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorobenzene, also disrupt the endocrine system through interaction with hormone receptors. Endogenous hormones, such as 17β-estradiol (E2), are released in the urine and feces of farm animals and seep into terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems through sewage. Pigs are widely used as animal models to determine the effects of EDCs because they are physiologically, biochemically, and histologically similar to humans. EDCs primarily disrupt the reproductive and nervous systems of pigs. Moreover, embryonic development during the prenatal and early postnatal periods is particularly sensitive to EDCs. Mycotoxins, such as zearalenone, are food contaminants that alter hormonal activities in pigs. Mycotoxins also alter the innate immune system in pigs, making them vulnerable to diseases. It has been reported that farm animals are exposed to various types of EDCs, which accumulate in tissues, such as those of gonads, livers, and intestines.

For the meta-analyses, dose was defined as the product of the concentration inhaled PERC and the duration of exposure, expressed in unites of ppm-h/1000 (for numerical convenience). Dose-related results were highly variable across studies. Reports involving low exposure concentrations characteristic of nonoccupational exposures consistently produced effects of a magnitude that were comparable to those reported for higher concentration occupational studies. If this finding is reliable and general, studies of occupationally exposed persons may underestimate the magnitude of effects of PERC and other chemicals in the total population. Given the limited scope of the available data for PERC and its methodological and reporting problems (small sample sizes, testers were not blind to the subjects' exposure conditions, and the timing and location of testing were insufficiently documented), it seems important to test this conclusion with a well-documented study of two groups (occupational and nonoccupational exposure) in which subjects are evaluated in randomized order, using the same procedures and with the testers kept blind to the status of the subjects.","<p>Place: England</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not organochlorine pesticide",10.1080/15287390902800413,Humans;Dose-Response Relationship;Drug;Time Factors;Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects;Central Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced;Tetrachloroethylene/*adverse effects;Visual Acuity/drug effects,,

We performed a literature search of peer-reviewed studies, published until January 2021, without language restrictions. Summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived from stratified random-effects meta-analyses by type of exposure and outcome, exposed populations and window of exposure to address the large heterogeneity of existing literature. Heterogeneity and small-study effects were also assessed. We identified 55 eligible studies (n = 48 case-control and n = 7 cohorts) from over 30 countries assessing &gt;200 different exposures of pesticides (n = 160,924 participants). The summary OR for maternal environmental exposure to pesticides (broad term) during pregnancy and AL was 1.88 (95%CI: 1.15–3.08), reaching 2.51 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 95%CI: 1.39–4.55). Analysis by pesticide subtype yielded an increased risk for maternal herbicide (OR: 1.41, 95%CI: 1.00–1.99) and insecticide (OR: 1.60, 95%CI: 1.11–2.29) exposure during pregnancy and AL without heterogeneity (p = 0.12–0.34). Meta-analyses of infant leukemia were only feasible for maternal exposure to pesticides during pregnancy. Higher magnitude risks were observed for maternal pesticide exposure and infant ALL (OR: 2.18, 95%CI: 1.44–3.29), and the highest for infant acute myeloid leukemia (OR: 3.42, 95%CI: 1.98–5.91). Overall, the associations were stronger for maternal exposure during pregnancy compared to childhood exposure. For occupational or mixed exposures, parental, and specifically paternal, pesticide exposure was significantly associated with increased risk of AL (ORparental: 1.75, 95%CI: 1.08–2.85; ORpaternal: 1.20, 95%CI: 1.07–1.35).

In Western countries pesticides, together with new and modified patterns of exposure to chemicals, have been implicated in the increasing prevalence of diseases associated with alterations of the immune response, such as hypersensitivity reactions, certain autoimmune diseases and cancers. Xenobiotics may initiate, facilitate or exacerbate pathological immune processes, resulting in immunotoxicity by induction of mutations in genes coding for immunoregulatory factors, modifying immune tolerance and activation pathways. The purpose of this article is to update the evidence of pesticide immunotoxicity. Even if experimental data as well as sporadic human studies indicate that some pesticides can affect the immune system, overall, existing epidemiological studies are inadequate to raise conclusions on the immunotoxic risk associated to pesticide exposure. The available studies on the effects of pesticides on human immune system have several limitations including poor indication on exposure levels, multiple chemical exposures, heterogeneity of the approach, and difficulty in giving a prognostic significance to the slight changes often observed. Further studies are necessary, and they should be preferably carried out through comparison of pre and post-exposure findings in the same group of subjects with a matched control group. Attempt should be made to define the prognostic significance of slight changes often observed. Animal and in vitro studies are also important and necessary to scientifically support epidemiological evidences on pesticide-induced immunotoxicity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Here we aimed to review epidemiological studies published up until 2013, using the PubMed database. 20 studies dealing with respiratory health and non-occupational pesticide exposure were identified, 14 carried out on children and six on adults. In four out of nine studies in children with biological measurements, mothers’ dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) blood levels during pregnancy were associated with asthma and wheezing in young children. An association was also found between permethrin in indoor air during pregnancy and wheezing in children. A significant association between asthma and DDE measured in children’s blood (aged 7–10 years) was observed in one study. However, in three studies, no association was found between asthma or respiratory infections in children and pesticide levels in breast milk and/or infant blood. Lastly, in three out of four studies where post-natal pesticide exposure of children was assessed by parental questionnaire an association with respiratory symptoms was found. Results of the fewer studies on pesticide environmental exposure and respiratory health of adults were much less conclusive: indeed, the associations observed were weak and often not significant. In conclusion, further studies are needed to confirm whether there is a respiratory risk associated with environmental exposure to pesticides. © ERS 2015.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",10.1183/16000617.00006114,Pesticides;Environmental Exposure,,

However, previous studies did not specifically investigate the underlying mechanisms of its developmental toxicity. Here, we chose zebrafish embryos as the model, exposed them to 2 different concentrations of PCP, and sequenced their entire transcriptomes at 10 and 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf). The sequencing analysis revealed that high concentrations of PCP elicited systematic responses at both time points. By combining the enrichment terms with single genes, the results were further analyzed using three categories: metabolism, transporters, and organogenesis. Hyperactive glycolysis was the most outstanding feature of the transcriptome at 10 hpf. The entire system seemed to be hypoxic, although hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1 alpha) may have been suppressed by the upregulation of prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs). At 24 hpf, PCP primarily affected somitogenesis and lens formation probably resulting from the disruption of embryonic body plan at earlier stages. The proposed underlying toxicological mechanism of PCP was based on the crosstalk between each clue. Our study attempted to describe the developmental toxicity of environmental pollutants from a systematic view. Meanwhile, some features of gene expression profiling could serve as markers of human health or ecological risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",10.1038/srep25929,character(0),,

Due to analytical costs constraining the scope, sample size, and range of congeners analyzed, and variation in methodologies preventing cross-study syntheses, how PCBs biomagnify at food web, regional, and global scales remains uncertain. To overcome these constraints, we compiled diet (stable isotopes) data and lipid-normalized concentrations of sum total PCB (PCB(ST)), seven indicator PCB congeners, and their sum (PCB(∑7)). Our analyses revealed that the number of congeners analyzed, region, and class most strongly predicted PCB(ST), while similarly, region, class, and feeding location best predicted PCB(∑7) and all seven congeners. We also discovered that PCB(ST), PCB(∑7), and the seven indicator congeners all occur in higher concentrations in freshwater than marine ecosystems but are more likely to biomagnify in the latter. Moreover, although the seven congeners vary in their propensity to biomagnify, their trophic magnification factors are all generally greater in the Atlantic than the Pacific. Thus, novel insights regarding PCB biomagnification across taxonomic, food webs, regional, and global scales can be gleaned by leveraging existing data to overcome analytical constraints.","<p>Place: United States</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: wrong pdf in zotero,not organochlorine pesticide",10.1021/acs.est.9b07693,Bioaccumulation;Ecosystem;Food Chain;*Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis;*Water Pollutants;Chemical/analysis,,

Increased risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and breast cancer were also reported though the evidence was limited. However, some recent reviews of studies on PCB exposure and risk of cancer provided discrepant findings. Therefore, we re-evaluated the association between exposure to PCBs and risk of melanoma and NHL by a systematic review and meta-analysis. We retrieved 11 independent cohort studies on occupationally exposed workers. About half of them showed increased standardized mortality or incidence ratios (SMRs or SIRs) for melanoma and none for NHL. The pooled SMRs were 1.32 (95% CI: 1.05-1.64) for melanoma and 0.94 (0.73-1.23) for NHL. Among population-based cohort and case-control studies with individual measures of PCB exposure, one only study was carried out on PCB exposure and melanoma, showing an odds ratio (OR) of 6.0 (2.0-18.2) for the highest compared to lowest quartile of PCB distribution. 13 cohort and case-control studies evaluated the association between NHL and PCB concentration in blood or subcutaneous fat, with summary OR = 1.5 (1.1-1.7) for the highest vs lowest quantile of PCB distribution. However, two cohort studies on people intoxicated by rice oil containing PCBs found no excess of deaths for skin cancer and inconsistent results for NHL. In conclusion, these findings do not provide a strong evidence that PCB exposure can increase the risk of melanoma and NHL in humans.","<p>Place: England</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not organochlorine pesticide",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.05.053,"Humans;Meta-analysis;Review;Female;Young Adult;Lymphoma;PCB;Polychlorinated biphenyls;Air Pollutants;Incidence;Odds Ratio;Melanoma;Risk;Non-Hodgkin lymphoma;Cancer;Melanoma/chemically induced/*mortality;Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/*analysis;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*analysis/blood;Skin Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality;Subcutaneous Fat/chemistry;Non-Hodgkin/chemically induced/*mortality;Occupational/*analysis/blood;Hodgkin Disease;Non-Hodgkin;Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin",,
rayyan-894980491,Pesticides and childhood cancer: An update,2007,1,1,,14384639,210,5,,,,,,,"Objectives: Epidemiological studies have reported associations between childhood cancer and either parental or child exposure to pesticides. Reviews have been published in 1997, 1998 and 2006 where the evidence was found suggestive but not conclusive. The present review is an extended update of the latter one. Methods: The PubMed database was searched to identify published studies on this topic issued between 1998 and 2006. Results: Thirty-six new studies have been identified for this review. Some cohort studies and the majority of the case-control studies suggest an increased risk for the cancer types studied, associated with exposure to pesticides in at least one of a large variety of exposure categories. However, the evidence is conflicting with regard to cancer types as well as to causative factors across studies. The major shortcomings concern exposure assessment, where, e. g., ""farming"" is treated equal to ""exposure to pesticides"", disregarding other possible exposures, e.g., to biological or infectious agents, and hitherto unidentified lifestyle factors. Also, many exposure categories used, mainly in case-control studies, lack chemical or toxicological plausibility. In most studies exposures were categorized as ""ever vs. never"", with little regard of exposure intensity or duration. Conclusions: The available literature does not allow firm conclusions with regard to pesticides and any type of childhood cancer. But even if the reported associations were true, exposure to pesticides could not explain the vast majority of childhood cancer cases. Investing in the acquisition and critical review of exposure information appears to be the crucial step for causal assessment in future research. However, focusing on the presence of pesticides, and not asking the question why they were used, might mask relevant associations to other causative agents. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

Since 1987, 35 classes of chemicals consisting of 749 individual compounds and 1 mixture have been analyzed, in which antibiotics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were the most targeted analytes. For 13 classes of principal OCs (defined as chemicals detected in over five studies) in sludge, the median (expressed in nanograms per gram dry weight) was the highest for phthalate esters (27 900), followed by alkylphenol polyethoxylates (12 000), synthetic musks (5800), antibiotics (4240), PAHs (3490), ultraviolet stabilizers (670), bisphenol analogs (160), organochlorine pesticides (110), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (100), pharmaceuticals (84), hormones (69), perfluorinated compounds (21), and polychlorinated biphenyls (15). Concentrations of PAHs in sludges collected between 1998 and 2012 showed a decreasing trend.

These disorders can lead to decreased quality of life, missed school, urgent care and emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and increased health care costs. Environmental exposures, including pesticide exposure, are likely a contributing factor to this increased prevalence. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of pesticide exposure with childhood wheeze and asthma. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review evaluating studies of pesticide exposure (measured objectively) and child respiratory outcomes. We searched PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), CINAHL (EBSCO), Scopus (Elsevier), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Wiley), and ClinicalTrials.gov from 1988 - 2021. Main search keywords included ""pesticides"", ""insecticides"", ""herbicides"", ""respiratory"", ""asthma"" and ""wheeze"". RESULTS: Out of 5767 studies, 25 met the inclusion criteria; eight evaluated prenatal pesticide exposure (n=8407), twelve evaluated postnatal exposures (n=50,488), and five evaluated pre-and postnatal exposures (n=20,919). Main pesticides investigated were dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) (14 studies) followed by organophosphates (7 studies). Primary methods of outcome assessment were questionnaire-based (84%), followed by spirometry (16%), registry data, and blood measures. Studies varied in the strength of evidence relating to study design and measures. Most studies (84%) reported a positive association of exposure with adverse child respiratory health. CONCLUSION: The studies suggest an association of pesticide exposure and childhood wheeze and asthma. The varying results and methods reinforce the need for more research and standardized approaches to these studies to confirm the suggested association of pesticide exposure and childhood wheeze and asthma.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no pdf,full text not available",,Pesticides;Child;Asthma;Respiratory Sounds;Only Child,,

This review aims to provide a broad summary of this literature, comparing the state of epidemiological evidence for the effects of a wide range of environmental contaminants (air pollutants, heavy metals, organochlorine compounds, perfluoroalkyl substances, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, pesticides, phthalates and bisphenol A) on child health outcomes. The review addresses effects on foetal growth and prematurity, neurodevelopment, respiratory and immune health, and childhood growth and obesity. Findings of recent prospective studies and meta-analyses have corroborated previous good evidence, often at lower exposure levels, for effects on foetal growth of air pollution and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), for neurotoxic effects of lead, methylmercury, PCBs and organophosphate pesticides, and for respiratory health effects of air pollution. Moderate evidence has emerged for a potential role of environmental pollutants in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism (lead, PCBs, air pollution), respiratory and immune health (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene - DDE - and PCBs), and obesity (DDE). In addition, there is now moderate evidence that certain chemicals of relatively recent concern may be associated with adverse child health outcomes, specifically perfluorooctanoate and foetal growth, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers and neurodevelopment. For other chemicals of recent concern, such as phthalates and bisphenol A, the literature is characterised by large inconsistencies preventing strong conclusions. In conclusion, since most of the recent literature evaluates common exposures in the general population, and not particularly high exposure situations, this accumulating body of evidence suggests that the unborn and young child require more protection than is currently provided. Large, coordinated research efforts are needed to improve understanding of long-term effects of complex chemical mixtures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: umbrella review? | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",,Humans;Child;*Child Health;Child Development/drug effects;Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity;Fetal Development/drug effects;Immune System/drug effects;Neurodevelopmental Disorders/epidemiology;Obesity/epidemiology;Premature Birth/epidemiology;Respiratory Tract Diseases/epidemiology;Only Child;Child Welfare,,

Methods: Studies identified from a MEDLINE search through 15 January 2013 and from the reference lists of identified publications were submitted to a systematic review and meta-analysis. Relative risk estimates were extracted from 20 studies published between 1974 and 2010. Most of the retrieved studies involved farm/agricultural jobs. Summary ratio estimates (SR) were calculated according to fixed and random-effect meta-analysis models. Separate analyses were conducted after stratification for study design, exposure parameters, disease definition, geographic location and age at diagnosis. Results: Statistically significant associations were observed for parents potentially exposed to pesticides in occupational settings and the occurrence of brain tumor in their offspring after combining all case-control studies (summary odds ratio [SOR]: 1.30; 95%: 1.11, 1.53) or all cohort studies (summary rate ratio [SRR]: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.95). Significantly increased risks were seen for prenatal exposure windows, for either exposed parent, for exposure defined as to pesticides as well as by occupational/industry title, for astroglial brain tumors and after combining case-control studies from North America or cohort studies from Europe. Conclusions: This meta-analysis supports an association between parental occupational exposure to pesticides and brain tumors in children and young adults, and adds to the evidence leading to the recommendation of minimizing (parental) occupational exposure to pesticides. These results must, however, be interpreted with caution because the impact of work-related factors others than pesticide exposure is not known.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: figure 1 has each of the pesticide studies,does not distinguish pesticides into chemical classes",10.1016/j.envint.2013.02.011,Pesticides;Occupational Exposure;Brain;Brain Neoplasms,,

Summary odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using fixed-effects models. A total of seven studies were included in our meta-analysis. A positive association was observed between pesticide exposure and AD (OR = 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08, 1.67; n = 7).

The sensitivity analyses of the present meta-analysis did not substantially modify the association between pesticide exposure and AD. Subgroup analyses revealed that high-quality studies tended to show significant relationships.

An EFSA-commissioned systematic review of pesticide epidemiological studies (Ntzani et al. in Literature review on epidemiological studies linking exposure to pesticides and health effects. EFSA supporting publication 2013:EN-497, 2013) revealed statistically significant associations, among others, between pesticide exposures, and Parkinson’s disease and childhood leukemia. Thereafter, EFSA launched a project with a mandate for the plant protection products and their residues (PPR) Panel to set the ground for the use of epidemiological data in the risk assessment of pesticides, as requested by Regulation (EC) 1107/2009. The project culminated with the publication of two EFSA’s scientific opinions on the potential contribution of experimental investigations and epidemiological studies in PPP risk assessment and with the scientific conference held on 20 November 2017, in Parma, Italy. The application of modern methodologies in exposure assessment, toxicology and epidemiology would improve the pesticide risk assessment process and support a mechanistic shift for the integration of these three disciplines under a novel paradigm in risk assessment. The application of the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) conceptual framework to this approach would contribute to gain insight into the biological plausibility of a hazard identified in epidemiological or experimental studies and would inform an Integrated Approach to Testing and Assessment (IATA) within a regulatory context. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",10.1007/s00204-019-02467-w,Pesticides;Risk Assessment,,

The aim of this review was to analyze the effects of multiple occupational exposures and coexposures to chemical, biomechanical, and physical hazards on adverse health outcomes among agricultural workers. Methods: Articles published in English between 1990 and 2015 were identified using five popular databases and two complementary sources. The quality of the included publications was assessed using the methodology developed by the Effective Public Health Practice Project assessment tool for quantitative studies. Results: Fifteen articles were included in the review. Multiple chemical exposures were significantly associated with an increased risk of respiratory diseases, cancer, and DNA and cytogenetic damage. Multiple physical exposures seemed to increase the risk of hearing loss, whereas coexposures to physical and biomechanical hazards were associated with an increased risk of musculoskeletal disorders among agricultural workers. Conclusion: Few studies have explored the impact of multiple occupational exposures on the health of agricultural workers.

Previous systematic reviews of epidemiologic studies published between 1991 through 2013 have reported associations between environmental and occupational pesticide exposure and reduced sperm quality, particularly associations with reduced sperm concentration. This systematic review used the Navigation Guide to critically evaluate the current body of evidence examining sperm quality and pesticide exposure in epidemiological studies. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for all English-language articles published after September 2012 until August 2021. Original observational studies that assessed human sperm quality parameters, defined as concentration, motility, morphology, and DNA integrity, and individual-level pesticide exposure were included. The risk of bias for each included study and the strength of evidence were evaluated using the Navigation Guide protocol. Nineteen studies assessing environmental or occupational pesticide exposure and sperm parameters were included. Eighteen studies were cross-sectional studies and one prospective cohort; sample sizes ranged from 42 to 2122 men from 14 different countries. Fifteen (79 %) studies found at least one significant association between pesticide exposure and reduced sperm quality. The overall risk of bias across studies was classified as low to moderate. The quality of evidence was determined to be moderate based on systematic evaluation criteria. There were consistent adverse associations between pesticide exposure and sperm motility (63 % of studies) and DNA integrity (80 % of studies). For sperm concentration and morphology, 42 % and 36 % of studies found significant negative associations, respectively. The strength of the body of evidence overall was rated as having sufficient evidence of toxicity. Regarding specific sperm endpoints, there was sufficient evidence that pesticides are toxic for sperm motility and DNA integrity; limited evidence of toxicity for sperm concentration; and inadequate evidence of toxicity for sperm morphology. The studies reviewed here showed consistent associations between pesticide exposure and diminished sperm parameters, particularly sperm motility and sperm DNA integrity. These findings are largely consistent with results of previous reviews, which have found significant negative associations between pesticide exposure and sperm quality in 13 of 20 (65 %) studies published between 1991 and 2008, and in 14 of 17 (82 %) studies published between 2008 and 2012.

OBJECTIVE: We examined the relationship between prenatal OC concentrations and fetal anthropometry. METHODS: We measured 4,4´-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (4,4´-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners (138, 153, and 180) in 2,369 maternal and 1,140 cord serum samples in four Spanish cohorts (2003-2008). We used linear mixed models to obtain longitudinal growth curves for estimated fetal weight (EFW), abdominal circumference (AC), biparietal diameter (BPD), and femur length (FL) adjusted by parental and fetal characteristics. We calculated standard deviation (SD) scores of growth at 0-12, 12-20, and 20-34 weeks of gestation as well as size at gestational week 34 for the four parameters. We studied the association between OCs and the fetal outcomes by cohort-specific linear models and subsequent meta-analyses. RESULTS: PCBs were associated with a reduction in AC up to mid-pregnancy, and BPD and FL from gestational week 20 onward. An inverse association was also found between HCB and AC growth in early pregnancy. The reduction of these parameters ranged from -4% to -2% for a doubling in the OC concentrations. No association between 4,4´-DDE and fetal growth was observed. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to report an association between prenatal exposure to some PCBs and HCB and fetal growth: AC during the first two trimesters of pregnancy, and BPD and FL later in pregnancy.

We aimed to summarise the environmental risk factors that have been studied for potential association with Parkinson's disease, assess the presence of diverse biases, and identify the risk factors with the strongest support. Methods: We searched PubMed from inception to September 18, 2015, to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations between environmental factors and Parkinson's disease. For each meta-analysis we estimated the summary effect size by random-effects and fixed-effects models, the 95% confidence interval and the 95% prediction interval. We estimated the between-study heterogeneity expressed by I2, evidence of small-study effects and evidence of excess significance bias. Results: Overall, 75 unique meta-analyses on different risk factors for Parkinson's disease were examined, covering diverse biomarkers, dietary factors, drugs, medical history or comorbid diseases, exposure to toxic environmental agents and habits. 21 of 75 meta-analyses had results that were significant at p &lt; 0.001 by random-effects.

The dose-response relationship between PCP exposure and cancer risk was also analyzed. RESULTS: Major cancer mortality rates of exposure populations researched in American and Canadian studies were approximate to or lower than national male cancer mortality rates respectively. The incidence rate of colorectal cancer in occupational exposure population was over 16.4 times in comparison with the population exposed from to drinking water and food. The pooled SMR value of kidney cancer was 1.34 (95% CI 1.02-1.77). The pooled RR for major cancer mortality increased with the rise of PCP exposure level. CONCLUSION: A potential dose-response relationship between PCP exposure and cancer risk could exist.

Relative egg size and mass varies across species, reflecting differences in maternal investment. This variability may affect the maternal transfer of anthropogenic pollutants including lipophilic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and protein-associated per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mercury (Hg). We conducted a meta-analysis on seabirds and investigated whether interspecies variation in maternal investment contributes toward skewed pollutant concentration ratios between males and females, as C(male)/C(female) (80 studies). Overall concentrations of PCBs and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were 1.6 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, in males than females, whereas mercury was similar between sexes. Few studies compared females and eggs ( n = 6), highlighting a knowledge gap. We found that an increasing maternal investment as a clutch-to-female mass ratio resulted in lower PCB concentrations in females than in males during the incubation period, but no sex-specific differences were observed for mercury and PFOS. Egg production is both a lipid dominated and protein-limited process. Females transfer lipophilic pollutants more easily to eggs, and to a higher degree with increasing maternal investment, but feeding ecology may be more important. Interspecies variation in maternal pollutant transfer may lead to negative effects scaling from an offspring to population level.","<p>Place: United States</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not organochlorine pesticide",10.1021/acs.est.9b01296,Male;Animals;Female;Ovum;Eggs;*Environmental Pollutants;*Polychlorinated Biphenyls;*Birds;*Reproduction,,

The present study aimed to investigate, using a meta-analysis approach, the variations in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A-like enzyme induction based on ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity (EROD) and selected physiological variables (retinoids and thyroid hormones) in northern fulmar breeding in three differentially OC-exposed populations: Nunavut (Canadian Arctic), Svalbard (Norwegian Arctic) and the Faroe Islands. Substantially higher (roughly two-fold) OC levels were uncovered in the liver of this long-lived fulmarine petrel breeding in the Faroe Islands relative to Svalbard and Nunavut. Liver levels of PCDDs, PCDFs and non-ortho PCBs in Faroe Islands fulmars were amongst the highest reported thus far in any seabirds from the northern regions. Positive correlations were depicted in combined fulmars (all three populations) between hepatic EROD activity and concentrations of OCs, in which strongest associations were found for dioxin-like compound (PCDFs and PCDDs) and TEQ concentrations. Moreover, moderate to strong positive correlations were found between liver OC concentrations and plasma total thyroxin (TT(4)) levels and TT(4)/total triiodothyronine (TT(3)) level ratios, as well as strong negative correlations between the same suite of OCs and plasma TT(3) levels. Hepatic OC concentrations (PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs, HCB, p,p'-DDE and oxychlordane) also were positively correlated with hepatic retinyl palmitate levels which, in turn, were associated with a significant decrease in plasma retinol levels and somewhat unchanged liver retinol levels. The present meta-analysis investigation on northern fulmar breeding in three geographically-distant sites illustrated that OC exposure (mainly PCBs and dioxins/furans) may be associated with modulation of the thyroid and retinoid homeostasis. However, the impact of confounding environmental factors (e.g., temperature and nutritional status) on current physiological variable variations could not be ruled out, and thus any cause-effect linkages between thyroid and retinoid system perturbation and OC exposure cannot be ascertained.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis,not conventional meta-analysis",,Hydrocarbons;Animals;Thyroid Gland;Thyroid Hormones;Arctic Regions;Canada;Dibenzofurans;Polychlorinated;Svalbard;Nunavut;Denmark;Environmental Monitoring/*methods;Environmental Pollutants/metabolism;Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene/metabolism;Liver/metabolism;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis;Benzofurans/metabolism;Biomarkers/metabolism;Birds/*metabolism;Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/metabolism;Diterpenes;Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins/analogs & derivatives/metabolism;Retinoids/*metabolism;Retinyl Esters;Thyroid Gland/chemistry;Thyroid Hormones/*metabolism;Vitamin A/analogs & derivatives/metabolism;Chlorinated/metabolism,,

We present an overview of studies on PCBs in the Arctic and combine these with the findings from ArcRisk-a major European Union-funded project aimed at examining the effects of climate change on the transport of contaminants to and their behaviour of in the Arctic-to provide a case study on the behaviour and impact of PCBs over time in the Arctic. PCBs in the Arctic have shown declining trends in the environment over the last few decades. Atmospheric long-range transport from secondary and primary sources is the major input of PCBs to the Arctic region. Modelling of the atmospheric PCB composition and behaviour showed some increases in environmental concentrations in a warmer Arctic, but the general decline in PCB levels is still the most prominent feature. `Within-Arctic' processing of PCBs will be affected by climate change-related processes such as changing wet deposition. These in turn will influence biological exposure and uptake of PCBs. The pan-Arctic rivers draining large Arctic/sub-Arctic catchments provide a significant source of PCBs to the Arctic Ocean, although changes in hydrology/sediment transport combined with a changing marine environment remain areas of uncertainty with regard to PCB fate. Indirect effects of climate change on human exposure, such as a changing diet will influence and possibly reduce PCB exposure for indigenous peoples. Body burdens of PCBs have declined since the 1980s and are predicted to decline further.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",10.1007/s11356-018-2625-7,character(0),,

Recent studies often reached inconsistent conclusions. Objective: To update our earlier systematic review on the association between residential/household/domestic exposure to pesticides and childhood leukemia, and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity not previously assessed. Methods: A systematic search of studies published in English between January 2009 and June 2018 was conducted in MEDLINE, and a “snowball searching” was performed from the reference list of identified publications and from Web of Science citations. Risk estimates were extracted from 15 case-control studies published between 1987 and 2018. The quality of the publications was assessed by using a modified version of the Downs and Black (1998) checklist. A random-effect meta-analysis model was used to calculate summary odds ratios (SOR) and separate analyses were conducted for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), unspecified AL/leukemia and any leukemia types. Stratification by critical exposure period, exposure location, pesticide biocide category, child age at diagnosis, study quality, specific exposures, type of pest treated, and geographic location were performed. Results: A statistically significant association between residential pesticide exposure and childhood leukemia was observed by combining all studies (SOR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.27–1.95) without evidence of publication bias. Statistically significant increased risks were observed for all types of leukemia, and specifically for exposure during pregnancy, indoor exposure, prenatal exposure to insecticides and whatever the age at diagnosis. Statistical significance was also reached for high quality studies, pet treatments, professional pest control treatment and use of insect repellants, mosquito treatment and for studies from USA/Canada or International. The highest increased risks were observed for AML among children aged 2 years or less, as well as for unspecified leukemia type observed after prenatal indoor exposure. Conclusions: A positive association between domestic pesticide exposure and childhood leukemia is confirmed.

Although pesticides have been implicated in studies of prostate cancer among farmers, meta-analyses have found heterogeneity across studies, and a number of exposures and lifestyle factors may be unique to farmers. The purpose of this paper is to review the epidemiologic literature to evaluate the hypothesis that agricultural exposure to pesticides is causally associated with prostate cancer risk. We analyzed the eight cohort studies and five case-control studies that quantified and/or evaluated agricultural exposure to particular pesticide classes or chemicals. Despite sporadic positive findings, these studies did not show consistently increased risks to support a causal association between agricultural pesticide use and prostate cancer. Studies using an 'external' comparison group must be interpreted in the context of confounding by differences in prostate-specific antigen screening intensity. Furthermore, most studies did not adjust for potential confounders other than age and time period. It is clearly not possible to exonerate any particular pesticide as a putative cause of prostate cancer - to do so would require an inverse empirical association with an upper confidence limit below the null value.

To date, debate continues as to the origins of NDs. Increases in widespread exposure to and bioaccumulation of chemical neurotoxicants have paralleled the upsurge in NDs, and are suggested to be causal agents for NDs. One consistent aspect of NDs is the male preponderance. This review considers the issue of male preponderance by reviewing the gender‑specific neurotoxic effects of recognized neurotoxicant chemicals to assess their possible etiology in NDs. This investigation consisted of a systematic literature review of original studies published from 1970-2016 on suspected neurotoxicants, to examine whether they have a disproportionate adverse effect based on gender. Based on that review, the neurotoxicants exhibiting consistent gender‑specific effects, with exposed males being more affected (than similarly exposed females), were: lead, Thimerosal/ethylmercury, some organochlorine pesticides (e.g., dieldrin, endosulfan, and heptachlor), and air pollution. The next group identified were neurotoxicants exhibiting gender‑specific neurotoxic effects, with males being somewhat (but not consistently) more affected than females: mercury vapor, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organophosphate pesticides. Finally, there was a group of studies in which the neurotoxicants exhibited apparent gender‑related neurotoxic effects but failed to show whether exposed males were consistently more affected than females: inorganic mercury salts, methylmercury species, and certain endocrine disruptors (e.g., phthalates and BPA). The overall conclusion from the studies reviewed was that the brain in males is more vulnerable to many toxic exposures than it is in females. Evidence suggests that the reasons for the male brain being more vulnerable include: (1) greater glutathione availability in females; (2) greater sulfate‑based detoxification capacity in females; (3) potentiating effects of co‑exposure to neurotoxicants and testosterone; (4) greater neuroinflammatory response in males; (5) reduced vulnerability to oxidative stress in females; and (6) neuroprotective effects of female hormones (estrogen and progesterone), especially in the reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",,Humans;Male;Female;Brain;Sex Characteristics;Brain/*drug effects;Developmental Disabilities/*chemically induced;Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*etiology/pathology;Neurotoxins/*toxicity,,
rayyan-894980515,Pesticides in the urban environment: A potential threat that knocks at the door,2020,1,1,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,0048-9697,711,,,,,,,,"Pesticides play a pivotal role in controlling pests and disease infestations not only in urban agriculture but also in non-agricultural settings. Several pesticides like herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, etc. are applied unintentionally at higher concentrations even in small urban areas such as lawns, gardens and impermeable surfaces. Consequent to their indiscriminate use, both extensively and intensively, in the urban areas, contamination of pesticides poses a serious threat to the environment, living organisms and food safety. Although the fate and ecological effects of pesticides and their residues have been thoroughly understood in agricultural soils, information available in the literature on the impact of these contaminants in the urban environment is very limited and fragmentary. In fact, the fate and behaviour of pesticide residues in the urban environment are distinct from those in other ecosystems since the soils in urban areas greatly vary in their physico-chemical properties. Development of sustainable and eco-friendly approaches for remediation of even urban soils contaminated with pesticides is therefore greatly warranted. Thus, the present critical review is the first single source that provides updated knowledge on the sources, nature and extent of pesticide pollution in the urban environment, and the ecological and human health effects of pesticides and their residues. The potential of nano-encapsulation of pesticides for their application in urban settings has also been discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Another possibility may be that most BC studies are skewed towards individuals at average risk, which may limit the ability to detect signals from ECE. OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the literature on ECE and BC focusing on three types of studies or subgroup analyses based on higher absolute BC risk: BC family history (Type 1); early onset BC (Type 2); and/or genetic susceptibility (Type 3). METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed database to identify epidemiologic studies examining ECE and BC risk published through June 1, 2019. RESULTS: We identified 100 publications in 56 unique epidemiologic studies. Of these 56 studies, only 2 (3.6%) were enriched with BC family history and only 11% of studies (6/56) were specifically enriched with early onset cases. 80% of the publications from these 8 enriched studies (Type 1: 8/10 publications; Type 2: 8/10 publications) supported a statistically significant association between ECE and BC risk including studies of PAH, indoor cooking, NO(2), DDT; PCBs, PFOSA; metals; personal care products; and occupational exposure to industrial dyes. 74% of Type 3 publications (20/27) supported statistically significant associations for PAHs, traffic-related air pollution, PCBs, phthalates, and PFOSAs in subgroups of women with greater genetic susceptibility due to variants in carcinogen metabolism, DNA repair, oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis and tumor suppressor genes. DISCUSSION: Studies enriched for women at higher BC risk through family history, younger age of onset and/or genetic susceptibility consistently support an association between an ECE and BC risk. In addition to measuring exposures during WOS, designing studies that are enriched with women at higher absolute risk are necessary to robustly measure the role of ECE on BC risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",,Humans;Female;Environmental Exposure;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Breast Neoplasms;Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons;Cooking;*Environmental Exposure;*Breast Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology;*Environmental Pollutants/toxicity,,

Evidence suggested that lifelong exposure to pesticides might contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, but the results were controversial. Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed and Web of Science through September 2017. We included cohort and case-control studies reporting relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of three or more categories of pesticide exposure and PD. Ten articles with 13 reports (3 for cumulative exposure, 10 for duration exposure) were included. A nonlinearity association was seen between duration exposure and PD risk (P = 0.01 for nonlinearity). The summary ORs of developing PD for 5 and 10 years of duration exposure were 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02–1.09) and 1.11 (95% CI: 1.05–1.18), respectively. Sensitivity analyses with different effect models yielded similar results, and omission of any single study did not change the results.

The corrected portion of each exposure source was determined to be 90% for food, 9% for water, and 1% for air. The total hazard quotient (HQ) was determined to be within an unsafe range, and the total excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) was determined to be at a high risk of oral carcinogenesis. It is suggested that a comprehensive study be conducted in a specific period for all sources of exposure in all counties of Iran.

Brazil, due to its large size and wide range of environmental challenges, presents numerous hazards to children's health. The aim of this study was to systematically review the scientific literature that describes children's exposures to environmental pollutants in Brazil and their effects on Brazilian children's health. A systematic review of the scientific literature was performed without language restrictions and time of publication (years). The literature search was conducted in the following key resources: PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus and Web of Science with the MeSH Terms: Environmental exposure AND Brazil (filters: Human, Child [birth to 18 years] and Affiliation Author). The Virtual Health Library was also employed to access the databases Scielo and Lilacs. The search strategy was [DeCS Terms]: Child OR adolescent AND Environmental exposure AND Brazil. Health effects in children associated with exposure to environmental pollutants in Brazil were reported in 74 studies, during the period between 1995 and 2015. The most frequently cited effect was hospital admission for respiratory causes including wheezing, asthma, and pneumonia among children living in areas with high concentrations of air pollutants. A broad spectrum of other health effects possibly linked to pollutants also was found such as prematurity, low birth weight, congenital abnormality (cryptorchidism, hypospadia, micropenis), poor performance in tests of psychomotor and mental development, and behavioral problems. Exposure to pesticides in utero and postnatally was associated with a high risk for leukemia in children <2 years old. These results show that there is a need in Brazil for stricter monitoring of pollutant emissions and for health surveillance programs especially among vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and young children. © 2016 The Authors","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",10.1016/j.aogh.2016.02.007,Child;Brazil;Environmental Health;Only Child,,

Based on literature review, most of studies have been conducted in Asian countries, and the amount that have been reported in water resources in these countries was more than the permissible level. The high-level of -HCH (Lindane) pesticides in groundwater with concentration approximate to 82.21g/L was detected in China. In addition, the maximum measured concentration of Diazinon was detected in surface water in Iran with the value of approximate to 768.91g/L.

This study presents a meta-analysis of HPC burdens in human and wildlife tissues, including OH-PCBs, OH-PBDEs, Pentachlorophenol, and polybromophenols. HPC blood plasma levels were also compared to known in vitro and in vivo toxicological effect concentrations. Blood, highly perfused, and fetal tissues contained the highest levels of HPCs. Plasma concentrations of analyzed OH-PCBs/PBDEs ranged from 0.1 to 100 nM in humans and up to 240, 454, 800, and 7650 nM for birds, fish, cetaceans, and other mammals, respectively. These concentrations fully fall within the in vitro effect concentrations reported in literature for HPCs of 0.05-10000 nM. We strongly advise further study of HPC blood levels in the general population, children, and fetal tissue to establish background levels and the risk at sensitive development stages. As not all HPCs are, or can be, chemically analyzed, the application of additional bioanalysis might reveal an even greater toxicological relevance of HPCs.

rayyan-894980524,Intensified food production and correlated risks to human health in the Greater Mekong Subregion: a systematic review,2015,1,1,ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,,14,,,,,,,,"Background: Intensified food production, i.e. agricultural intensification and industrialized livestock operations may have adverse effects on human health and promote disease emergence via numerous mechanisms resulting in either direct impacts on humans or indirect impacts related to animal and environmental health. For example, while biodiversity is intentionally decreased in intensive food production systems, the consequential decrease in resilience in these systems may in turn bear increased health risks. However, quantifying these risks remains challenging, even if individual intensification measures are examined separately. Yet, this is an urgent task, especially in rapidly developing areas of the world with few regulations on intensification measures, such as in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). Methods: We systematically searched the databases PubMed and Scopus for recent studies conducted on the association between agricultural (irrigation, fertilization, pesticide application) and livestock (feed additives, animal crowding) intensification measures and human health risks in the GMS. The search terms used were iteratively modified to maximize the number of retrieved studies with relevant quantitative data. Results: We found that alarmingly little research has been done in this regard, considering the level of environmental contamination with pesticides, livestock infection with antibiotic resistant pathogens and disease vector proliferation in irrigated agroecosystems reported in the retrieved studies. In addition, each of the studies identified focused on specific aspects of intensified food production and there have been no efforts to consolidate the health risks from the simultaneous exposures to the range of hazardous chemicals utilized. Conclusions: While some of the studies identified already reported environmental contamination bearing considerable health risks for local people, at the current state of research the actual consolidated risk from regional intensification measures cannot be estimated. Efforts in this area of research need to be rapidly and considerably scaled up, keeping pace with the current level of regional intensification and the speed of pesticide and drug distribution to facilitate the development of agriculture related policies for regional health promotion.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Excluded"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis",10.1186/s12940-015-0033-8,Humans;Humanism;Humanities,,

METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Eligible studies (prospective) were search in PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and SciELO databases (July 11, 2020). Different search algorithms were used for diabetes and HTN. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were estimated from meta-analysis with random effects for each exposure and outcome. RESULTS: A total of 23 prospective studies were included in this review, 16 assessed diabetes and seven HTN; very few measured p,p'-DDT. Exposure to p,p'-DDE was associated with a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (pooled OR = 1.44; 95%CI: 1.00, 2.07; p = 0.049) and HTN (pooled OR = 1.21; 95%CI: 1.07, 1.38).

Exposure to p,p'-DDE was not associated with gestational diabetes (pooled OR = 1.01; 95%CI: 0.94, 1.09); similarly, p,p'-DDT was not associated with T2D (pooled OR = 1.03; 95%CI: 0.79, 1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from prospective studies suggests that exposure to p,p'-DDE, the main breakdown product of p,p'-DDT, might increase the risk of developing T2D; such increase may be apparent only at low levels.

Data in the public domain yielded 970 toxicity endpoint data sets, representing 71 pesticides and 42 soil invertebrate species or groups. For most pesticides, the most frequent effect class was for no observed effects, although relatively high numbers of pronounced and persistent effects occurred when Lumbricidae and Enchytraeidae were exposed to fungicides and when Lumbricidae, Collembola, and Arachnida were exposed to insecticides. No effects of fungicides on Arachnida, Formicidae, or Nematoda or of herbicides on Lumbricidae, Formicidae, or Nematoda were observed in any studies. For most pesticides, higher-tier no-observed-effect concentration or lowest-observed-effect concentration values cannot be determined because of a lack of information at low pesticide concentrations. Ten pesticides had sufficient laboratory data to enable the observed higher-tier effects to be compared with 5% hazardous concentrations (HC5) estimated from acute toxicity laboratory data (atrazine, carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, gamma-hexachlorocy-clohexane, lambda-cyhalothrin, parathion, pentachlorophenol, and propoxur). In eight cases, higher-tier effects concentrations were within or below the 90% confidence interval of the HC5. Good agreement exists between the results of TME and field tests for carbendazim, but insufficient information is available for a comparison between TME and field studies for other pesticides.

Poisonings with pesticides are assumed to be among the main causes for the decline of the honey bee population. Despite the significant progress observed in analytics over recent years, research aimed at improving methods applied in diagnostics of bee poisoning is still in progress. This is no easy task, since determination of the content of trace amounts (often equal to sublethal doses) of a wide range of compounds with diverse physico-chemical properties in honey bee samples with a complex matrix composition poses a serious challenge to modern analytics. This overview is the first to include a comprehensive critical assessment of analytical methods proposed for quantification of pesticides in honey bees over the last decade. Since the QuEChERS method is currently of great significance to ensuring accurate and reliable results of pesticide quantification in honey bees, the present overview focuses on the major aspects of this method, which will provide a comprehensive reference for scientists. The review focuses on the limitations of methods and on potential future prospects. It also contains information on the detection of pesticides in honey bees between 2010 and 2020 and characterizes the pesticide classes which are most toxic to these insects.

Methods This overview utilized systematic review methods to synthesize evidence from multiple systematic reviews and economic evaluations. A comprehensive search was conducted based on a predefined protocol, including clear inclusion criteria. To be classified as ""sustainable"" interventions needed to aim (explicitly or implicitly) to 1) have a positive impact on at least two key dimensions of the United Nations integrated framework for sustainable development and 2) include measures of health impact. Results Thirteen systematic reviews and two economic evaluations met the inclusion criteria. The interventions that were most likely to have a positive impact on health included 1) legislation to ban Endosulfan pesticide to prevent fatal poisonings; 2) testing of drinking water for contamination with arsenic, and dissemination of the results to households; and 3) implementation of organic farming / diet to reduce exposure to pesticides. However, the cost-effectiveness of these three interventions and their impact(s) on health inequalities is not known. Strict enforcement of interventions to reduce lead in houses with children was cost-beneficial. Education and dust control interventions performed by cleaning professionals to reduce blood lead levels in children were ineffective. Conclusions What is needed now is careful implementation of the interventions whose impacts are likely to be positive. Ineffective interventions need to be replaced with more effective and cost-effective interventions. Finally, more and better-quality research on the prevention of toxic exposure to chemicals is needed to better support policy development.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: umbrella review | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: umbrella review,full text not available | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",,Humans;Conservation of Natural Resources;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Lead;Review Literature as Topic;United Nations;Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity;Environmental Exposure/economics/*prevention & control;Pesticides/toxicity,,

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the associations between four types of EDCs (bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates (PAEs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)) and markers of inflammation and immune responses in humans. Three databases were searched, and 36 studies with a total of 22055 participants were included. The associations between EDCs and 26 inflammation-related acute phase proteins and cytokines were analyzed. The results demonstrated that exposure to BPA was positively associated with circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6. Exposure to PAEs was associated with elevated levels of CRP, IL-6 and IL-10. Subgroup analysis found that three PAE metabolites mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) were directly associated with a higher level of CRP, and two other PAE metabolites mono-carboxyisononyl phthalate (MCNP) and mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP) were positively associated with IL-6. The positive associations between PAEs and CRP, IL-6 and IL-10 were significant in the high-molecular-weight phthalate (HMWP) exposure group, not the low-molecular-weight phthalate (LMWP) exposure group. Exposure to OCPs was positively associated with CRP, IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-10. No significant association was found between PCBs and inflammatory markers. These findings demonstrate that exposure to EDCs is closely linked to dysregulated inflammatory responses. More studies should be conducted in the future to get a comprehensive view of the associations between different EDCs and inflammation, and investigations on the underlying mechanisms are needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",,Inflammation,,

To be useful in environmental monitoring, a biological response must reflect the environmental stress over time in a quantitative way. We here argue that the time required for initial induction, maximum induction, adaptation and recovery of these stress responses must first be fully understood and considered before they can be used in environmental monitoring, or else erroneous conclusions (both false-negative and false-positive) may be drawn when interpreting results. In this study, data on initial induction, maximum induction, adaptation and recovery of stress responses at various biological hierarchies (i.e., molecular, biochemical, physiological, behavioral, cytological, population and community responses) upon exposure to environmentally relevant levels of contaminants (i.e., metals, oil, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorines, organophosphates, endocrine disruptors) were extracted from 922 papers in the biomarker literature and analyzed. Statistical analyses showed that: (a) many stress responses may decline with time after induction (i.e., adaptation), even if the level of stress remains constant; (b) times for maximum induction and recovery of biochemical responses are positively related; (c) there is no evidence to support the general belief that time for induction of responses at a lower biological hierarchy (i.e., molecular responses and biochemical responses) is shorter than that at higher hierarchy (i.e., physiological, cytological and behavioral responses), although longer recovery time is found for population and community responses; (d) there are significant differences in times required for induction and adaptation of biological responses caused by different types of contaminants; (e) times required for initial and maximum induction of physiological responses in fish are significantly longer than those in crustaceans; and (f) there is a paucity of data on adaptation and recovery of responses, especially those at population and community levels. The above analyses highlight: (1) the limitations and possible erroneous conclusions in the present use of biomarkers in biomonitoring programs, (2) the importance of understanding the details of temporal changes of biological responses before employing them in environmental management, and (3) the suitability of using specific animal groups as bioindicator species.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",,Animals;Species Specificity;Time Factors;Stress;Analysis of Variance;Adaptation;Environmental Exposure/*analysis;Environmental Monitoring/*methods;Environmental Pollution/*analysis;Biomarkers/*metabolism;Physiological/*physiology;Physiological/*physiopathology,,

To date, the science of immunotoxicology has primarily focused on immunosuppression and hypersensitivity/allergy, and test methods are available to address these outcomes. So much progress has been made to address immunosuppression and contact sensitization that there are regulatory guidelines in the U.S. included in the registration of pesticides. In contrast, there are no validated approaches to assess autoimmunity. The overall objective of this paper will be to use pesticides as an important class of environmental chemicals to critically evaluate the state of the science for addressing chemical-induced autoimmunity. Specific examples of studies with pesticides will be discussed in the context of the following types of approaches: animal studies using standard immunotoxicological parameters; animal studies using specialized models of autoimmunity; human studies after environmental or occupational exposure; and human studies after accidental poisoning.

The aetiology remains largely unknown, but current evidence suggests that it is multi-causal and oestrogen-dependent. Many epidemiologic studies have explored associations between organochlorine chemicals (OCCs) and endometriosis, but the findings are inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: A systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis were conducted to gather and synthesize all the available evidence from human epidemiological studies about the associations between OCCs and endometriosis. DATA SOURCES: The searches were conducted in PubMed and Web of Science in June 2016 with a final follow-up in August 2018. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Only human epidemiological studies were considered, independent of participant age, body mass index or life-stage. Studies reporting individual measures of exposure to OCCs were included, considering but not limited to polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), or organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). The primary health outcome was presence of endometriosis, including all sub-types. Eligibility criteria excluded articles not written in English, conference papers, reviews and studies with overlapping information. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: A SR protocol pre-registered at PROSPERO was applied in duplicate to gather and extract all eligible original papers from PUBMED and Web of Science databases. Odds ratios were pooled using the inverse variance method for random effects meta-analysis for each group of OCCs. Risk of bias was assessed using the National Toxicology Program/Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP/OHAT) Risk of Bias Rating Tool for Human and Animal Studies adapted to the review question. The confidence in the body of evidence and related level of evidence was measured by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) based NTP/OHAT framework. The results were structured and presented in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 51 studies retained for the full-text screening, 17 provided effect sizes and metrics sufficient for pooling estimates through meta-analysis. The overall odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 1.65 (1.14; 2.39) for dioxins (n = 10), 1.70 (1.20; 2.39) for PCBs (n = 9), and 1.23 (1.13; 1.36) for OCPs (n = 5). Despite being statistically significant, these estimates should be considered with caution given the notable heterogeneity and small estimated effect size. Misclassification of exposure, due to varying laboratory detection rate capabilities, and disease status, due to varying definitions of endometriosis, were identified as major sources of uncertainty. LIMITATIONS, CONCLUSIONS, AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: The level of evidence was considered to be ""moderate"" with ""serious"" risk of bias according the NTP/OHAT criteria, supporting the need for further well-designed epidemiological research to fill lingering data gaps. Given the complexity of endometriosis and lack of known biomarkers suitable for population-based research, carefully designed observational studies play an important role in better understanding the aetiology of endometriosis, as will evolving mixture modeling approaches capable of handling various environmental chemical exposures. Attention to critical windows of exposure will shed further light on the possible developmental origin of endometriosis. Considering the high economic and societal cost associated with endometriosis, further research on this field is urged.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the association between EEDs, including nonylphenol (NP), bisphenol A (BPA), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), organo-chlorine pesticide (OCP) and phthalate (PAE) exposure and CVD risk. METHODS: The heterogeneity between different studies was qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated using Q test and I(2) statistical magnitude, respectively. Subgroup analysis was performed using chemical homologs - a previously unused grouping method - to extract data and perform meta-analysis to assess their exposure to CVD. RESULTS: Twenty-nine literatures were enrolled with a total sample size of 88891. The results indicated that exposure to PCB138 and PCB153 were the risk factors for CVD morbidity (odds ratio (OR) = 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.66; OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.13-1.62). Exposure to organo-chlorine pesticide (OCP) (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.00-1.24), as well as with phthalate (PAE) (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06-1.17) and BPA (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03-1.37) were positively associated with CVD risk, respectively. BPA exposure concentration had no correlation with total cholesterol (TC), or low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but exhibited a correlation with gender, waist circumference (WC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), age, and body mass index (BMI) (standardized mean difference (SMD)) = 1.51; 95% CI: =(1.01-2.25); SMD = 0.16; 95% CI: (0.08-0.23); SMD = -0.19; 95% CI: (-0.27-0.12); SMD = -0.78; 95% CI: (-1.42-0.14); SMD = 0.08; 95% CI: (0.00-0.16). CONCLUSIONS: EED exposure is a risk factor for CVD. Long-term exposure to EEDs can influence cardiovascular health in humans. A possible synergistic effect may exist between the homologs. The mechanism of which needs to be further explored and demonstrated by additional prospective cohort studies, results of in vitro and in vivo analyses, as well as indices affecting CVD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",,Humans;Body Mass Index;Cardiovascular Diseases;Prospective Studies;Risk Factors;*Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology;*Endocrine Disruptors/toxicity,,

Increasing evidence has associated obesity with persistent pollutants such as the pesticide DDT and its metabolite p,p′ -DDE. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to systematically review the literature on the association between exposure to the pesticide DDT and its metabolites and obesity to develop hazard identification conclusions. METHODS: We applied a systematic review-based strategy to identify and integrate evidence from epidemiological, in vivo, and in vitro studies. The evidence from prospective epidemiological studies was quantitatively synthesized by meta-analysis. We rated the body of evidence and integrated the streams of evidence to systematically develop hazard identification conclusions. RESULTS: We identified seven epidemiological studies reporting prospective associations between exposure to p,p′ -DDE and adiposity assessed by body mass index (BMI) z-score. The results from the meta-analysis revealed positive associations between exposure to p,p′ -DDE and BMI z-score (β =0:13 BMI z-score (95% CI: 0.01, 0.25) per log increase of p,p′ -DDE). Two studies constituted the primary in vivo evidence. Both studies reported positive associations between exposure to p,p′ -DDT and increased adiposity in rodents. We identified 19 in vivo studies and 7 in vitro studies that supported the biological plausibility of the obesogenic effects of p,p′ -DDT and p,p′ -DDE. CONCLUSIONS: We classified p,p′ -DDT and p,p′ -DDE as “presumed” to be obesogenic for humans, based on a moderate level of primary human evidence, a moderate level of primary in vivo evidence, and a moderate level of supporting evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies. © 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

In the present study, we aim to systematically appraise the epidemiological credibility of the environmental risk factors for rheumatic diseases. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed to capture meta-analyses of observational studies on environmental risk factors for the most prevalent rheumatic diseases. For each association, we estimated the summary effect size estimate, the 95% confidence and prediction intervals, and the I2 metric. We further examined the presence of small-study effects and excess significance bias. Results: Overall, we identified 30 eligible papers describing 42 associations. Thirty-three associations were statistically significant at P &lt; 0.05, whereas 13 of them were statistically significant at P &lt; 1 × 10−6. Thirty-two associations had large or very large between-study heterogeneity. In 12 associations, evidence of small-study effects and/or excess significance bias was found. Six risk factors (nine associations) presented convincing or highly suggestive evidence of association: smoking and pack-years of smoking for rheumatoid arthritis; BMI (per 5 kg/m2 increase) for gout and hip osteoarthritis; alcohol consumption for gout; BMI (overweight vs lean, obese vs lean), knee injury and participation in heavy work for knee osteoarthritis. Conclusion: Our umbrella review indicated that a narrow range of risk factors has been examined for rheumatic diseases.

Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are often the focus of Arctic contaminant exposure studies because they are apex predators with high contaminant loads. While early studies focused on describing and quantifying pollutants, present-day polar bear toxicological papers often incorporate ecological variables. This systematic literature review investigates the ecological and physiological variables that have been integrated in such studies. The systematic literature search resulted in 207 papers, published between 1970 and 2016. Representation of each of the 19 polar bear subpopulations varied from 0 to 72 papers; East Greenland, Barents Sea, Southern Beaufort Sea, and Lancaster Sound had the most published research, with over 30 papers each. Samples were collected between 1881 and 2015, primarily from harvested bears (66%); most from the 1990s and 2000s. Adipose tissue, liver, and blood were the most common tissues examined, and mean number of bears analyzed per paper was 76 (range 1-691). Papers investigating temporal trends did so using a mean sample of 61 bears over a 6-year period. The frequency with which ecological and physiological variables were integrated into toxicological papers varied. Age and (or) sex was the only ecological variable(s) considered in 51% of papers. Further, a total of 37% of the papers included in the review investigated physiological effects in relation to contaminant concentrations. Of the papers, 98% dealt with contaminant exposure at the individual level, leaving population level effects largely unstudied. Solitary subadult and adult polar bears were included in 57% and 79% of the papers, respectively. Younger bears were included in fewer papers: yearlings in 20% and cubs-of-the-year in 13%. Only 12% of the papers examined reproduction relative to contaminants. Finally, body condition was included in 26% of the research papers, whereas variables related to polar bear diet were included in <= 9%. Based on our findings, we suggest future polar bear toxicology studies increase sample sizes, include more ecological variables, increase studies on family groups, and increase the applicability of studies to management and conservation by examining pollution effects on reproduction and survival.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",10.1139/er-2016-0118,character(0),,

However, their extensive use has polluted the environment and increased human vulnerability to various chronic diseases. Pesticide exposure causes genetic and epigenetic modifications, endocrine disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Areas covered: This review is based on the literature studies currently reported on pesticide-induced toxicity and the protective role of melatonin. Scientific databases such as PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched using keywords ‘pesticide’ and ‘melatonin’ up to January 2016. Full length articles related to animal and human exposure were retrieved. A total number of 181 records were obtained, and after excluding the duplicates, 97 papers were further screened on the basis of relevance to the topic. Expert opinion: Melatonin as a broad-spectrum antioxidant is able to penetrate cellular compartments specifically the mitochondria. It is a potent free radical scavenger with low toxicity and desirable solubility in organic and aqueous phases.

These mainly anthropogenic pollutants have been widely detected in different areas of the planet, including the deep sea, and have impacts on marine life. Because of this potential toxicity, the global distribution, quantity, incidence, and potential impacts of deep-sea MPs were investigated in a systematic review of the literature. The results showed that MPs have reached different zones of the ocean and are more frequently reported in the Northern Hemisphere, where higher concentrations are found. MPs are also concentrated in depths up to 3000 m, where they are also more frequently studied, but also extend deeper than 10,000 m. Potentially toxic metals (PTMs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs), organotins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were identified as the most prevalent and widely distributed MPs at ≥200 m depth. PTMs are widely distributed in the deep sea in high concentrations; aluminum is the most prevalent up to 3000 m depth, followed by zinc and copper.

In Ukrainian children, the PC3 score (DEHP) was positively associated with current wheeze (adjusted OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.03-2.37), whereas the PC5 score, dominated by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), was inversely associated with current wheeze (OR 0.64, 0.41-0.99). In Greenlandic children, a negative association of PC4 (organochlorines) with ever eczema (OR 0.78, 0.61-0.99) was found.

rayyan-894980543,Organochlorine compounds and breast cancer risk,2003,1,1,,00334545,75,11,,,,,,,"A number of epidemiologic studies on organochlorines (OCs) and breast cancer risk have been published. The majority (n = 18) measured OCs in adipose tissue, primarily from mammary biopsies in cancer cases and controls with benign breast disease, and studied incident disease. Seven of these studies each included fewer than 50 cases and controls and had limited capacity for covariate adjustment. Eleven studies used serum samples collected from 6 months to 25 years prior to diagnosis. An additional 13 studies (2 with some overlap) used serum collected at or after diagnosis. Regardless of the medium used to measure OC levels, studies conducted to date do not provide consistent evidence that any of the OCs examined thus far play a role in the initial breast cancer risk. This paper provides a compound specific review with discussion of how the lack of evidence for adverse effects might be explained by factors related to study design, or by variation in risk across subgroups. The sum of the evidence does not implicate any OC compound as significantly related to risk of occurrence of breast cancer. The evidence base is greatest for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE). Limited research has been done on individual polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and their isomers. The studies of OC exposure reflect current exposure levels of chemicals banned as long ago as 20 years. Although the information is extremely limited and not without major design flaws, the association between OCs and disease severity and progression is interesting and worthy of further examination. More studies are needed on OCs other than DDTs in developing countries where use is more recent or continuing, especially given that most estrogenic OCs are not persistent. It is possible that other pathways may be involved, including activity related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST); there is limited research to date on this hypothesis. In developed countries, a body mass index (BMI)/weight loss model may warrant further analysis, perhaps using existing data. OC exposures cannot reliably be related to trends in breast cancer incidence, as other known risk factors for breast cancer, such as childbearing and lactation, have changed along with OC residues during this timeframe. Changes in screening and treatment over time also complicate making such links. Ecologic data relating high-exposure countries to high breast cancer mortality rates do not suggest a strong link. Breast cancer rates are not generally higher in parts of the world with high DDE levels. Countries with relatively similar levels of PCBs, such as Great Britain and Japan, have very different breast cancer rates. As OCs are present in the environment as mixtures of correlated isomers and metabolites, it may be difficult to distinguish possible causal links from associations in which measured compounds are merely markers of other underlying exposures. For highly correlated compounds, traditional adjustment strategies may not be feasible. More complex analytical strategies may help to isolate potentially relevant isomers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: meta-analysis?,no overall mean,no meta-analysis",10.1351/pac200375111973,Breast Neoplasms,,

Yet, toxicity of a chemical contaminant may vary in a temperature-dependent manner, depending on the physiology of the test organism and physicochemical properties of the chemical. Although an assessment factor of 10 (AF10) is commonly adopted to account for variability in toxicity data related to temperature in the development of water quality guidelines and/or ecological risk assessment, no one has ever rigorously assessed the appropriateness of AF10 to account for potential variation in temperature-dependent chemical toxicity to aquatic organisms. This study, therefore, aims to address this issue through a meta-analysis by comparing median lethal concentration data for nine chemicals (cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, silver, zinc, arsenic, selenium and DDT) on a range of freshwater ectothermic animal species at different temperatures, and to assess whether AF10 is under- or over-protective for tropical and temperate freshwater ecosystems. Our results reveal varying extents of interaction between temperature and different chemicals on organisms and the complexity of these interactions. Applying AF10 sufficiently protects 90% of the animal species tested over a range of temperatures for cadmium, copper, nickel, silver, zinc and DDT in the tropics, but it is insufficient to adequately encompass a larger temperature variation for most studied chemicals in temperate regions. It is therefore important to set specific AFs for different climatic zones in order to achieve the desired level of ecosystem protection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis,not conventional meta-analysis | USER-NOTES: {""Lorenzo""=>[""\""This study, therefore, aims to address this issue through a meta-analysis by comparing median lethal concentration data for nine chemicals (cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, silver, zinc, arsenic, selenium and DDT) on a range of freshwater ectothermic animal species at different temperatures\""""]}",,Animals;Ecology;Water Pollutants;Ecosystem;Risk Assessment;Temperature;Aquatic Organisms;Environmental Monitoring/methods/standards;Fresh Water/*chemistry;Chemical/analysis/*toxicity,,

Methods PubMed, EMbase, WanFang Data, VIP and CNKI databases were electronically searched to collect casecontrol studies on the relationship between prenatal exposure to DDT or PCBs and congenital anomalies from inception to February 2017. Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies, then, meta-analysis was performed by using Stata 13.0 software. Results A total of 14 studies involving 2 238 infants with defect and 2 335 infants without defect were included. The results of meta-analysis showed that: the prenatal exposure to high level of DDT increased the incidence of cryptorchidism (OR=1.12, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.15, P<0.001). However, DDT exposure had no correlation to hypospadias and neural tube defects.

METHODS: Publications during 1969-98 were surveyed. Studies without verified exposures were excluded. Meta-analyses were conducted on data from 92 studies covering 161 populations, with results for 23 agents or groups of agents. With a standard format, five epidemiologists extracted risk estimates and variables of the structure and quality of each study. The extracted data were centrally checked. Random meta-models were applied. RESULTS: Based on 20 populations, exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbon (CHC) solvents and related compounds was associated with a meta-risk ratio (MRR) of 1.4 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.0 to 1.8). Nickel and nickel compounds were considered in four populations (1.9; 1.2 to 3.2).

Heavy metals, organochlorines, chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons, and OP/carbamate pesticides were identified as the groups of xenobiotics for which there are toxicity data for terrestrial small mammals and that, on the basis of persistence, acute toxicity, and bio-accumulation potential, present the greatest hazard to wild mammals. Laboratory-generated toxicity data, which used lethality and reproduction as measurable endpoints, were reviewed and intake and residue LOAELs estimated for representative chemicals (lead, endrin, PCBs) from the heavy metal, organochlorine, and chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon substance groups; the OPs and carbamates were reviewed as a whole. Intakes and residues of these compounds in wild small mammals were compared with laboratory-defined LOAELs and the likelihood of effects predicted. The accuracy of these predictions was examined and the efficacy of extrapolating toxicity data from laboratory to wild species assessed. Qualitative extrapolation from laboratory to wild species was good for all the chemicals considered, laboratory tests correctly identifying the types of effects chemicals had on a wide range of wild mammals. In contrast, the quantitative extrapolation of dose-response data was either poor or largely unvalidated. This is because interspecies variation in sensitivity to xenobiotics and the effects on toxicity of differences in exposure pattern between laboratory and wild species are largely unquantified. Based upon the limited evidence available, errors in the direct extrapolation of dose-response data from laboratory to field may be as large as three orders of magnitude. Direct extrapolation of residue-response data from laboratory to wild mammals is good both for the effects of heavy metals on specific organs and for residues and acetylcholinesterase inhibition associated with pesticide-induced mortality. The use of organ residues or biomarkers to predict the severity of sublethal effects on reproductive output may be possible, although large residues or biomarker responses are not necessarily indicative of the severity of wider physiological effect. Appropriate residues/biomarkers may differ for various xenobiotics and even between species for the same xenobiotic. Further research is required to identify suitable markers that can be correlated with the occurrence and magnitude of ecologically important effects. Xenobiotics likely to have a direct effect on population dynamics are those that are persistent and adversely affect survival and reproduction. At present, this weak correlation is the only one that can be made between single-species laboratory tests and population effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: full text not available",,Animals;Rats;Mice;Environment;Predictive Value of Tests;Arvicolinae;Endrin/pharmacokinetics/toxicity;Insecticides/pharmacokinetics/toxicity;Lead/pharmacokinetics/toxicity;Mammals/*metabolism;Maximum Allowable Concentration;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/pharmacokinetics/toxicity;Shrews;Xenobiotics/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity,,

Another cohort study discovered that the white males had significantly elevated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma mortality (SMR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.15-3.17), and males of other races had increased leukemia mortality (SMR = 4.57, 95% CI = 1.25-11.7). For the relationship of childhood leukemia and parental exposure to PCP, three published studies suggested an increased risk of childhood leukemia because of their parental exposure to PCP at the preconception period. CONCLUSION: Our review provided the evidence that occupational exposure of workers to PCP might increase the risk of lymphoma and hematopoietic neoplasm in themselves and in their children.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not impact of organochlorine pesticides | USER-NOTES: {""Lorenzo""=>[""Pentachlorophenol is a OCP""]}",,Humans;Male;Female;Infant;Maternal Exposure;Newborn;Child;Preschool;Lymphoma;Occupational Exposure;Hematologic Neoplasms;Adolescent;Paternal Exposure;Odds Ratio;Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology;Lymphoma/*chemically induced/epidemiology;Mutagens/*poisoning;Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology;Occupational Exposure/*statistics & numerical data;Pentachlorophenol/*poisoning,,

OBJECTIVES: To test the possibility of applying a quantitative approach using human data linking chemical exposures and upstream biological perturbations to overt downstream outcomes. METHODS: Using polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposures and maternal thyroid hormone (TH) perturbations as a case study, we model three relationships: (1) prenatal PCB exposures and TH changes, using free T(4) (FT(4)); (2) prenatal TH and childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes; and (3) prenatal PCB exposures and childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes (IQ). We surveyed the epidemiological literature; extracted relevant quantitative data; and developed models for each relationship, applying meta-analysis where appropriate. RESULTS: For relationship 1, a meta-analysis of 3 studies gives a coefficient of -0.27 pg/mL FT(4) per ln(sum of PCBs) (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.82 to 0.27). For relationship 2, regression coefficients from three studies of maternal FT(4) levels and cognitive scores ranged between 0.99 IQ points/(pg/mL FT(4)) (95% CI -0.31 to 2.2) and 7.6 points/(pg/mL FT(4)) (95% CI 1.2 to 16.3). For relationship 3, a meta-analysis of five studies produces a coefficient of -1.98 IQ points (95% CI -4.46 to 0.50) per unit increase in ln(sum of PCBs). Combining relationships 1 and 2 yields an estimate of -2.0 to -0.27 points of IQ per unit increase in ln(sum of PCBs). CONCLUSIONS: Combining analysis of chemical exposures and early biological perturbations (PCBs and FT(4)) with analysis of early biological perturbations and downstream overt effects (FT(4) and IQ) yields estimates within the range of studies of exposures and overt effects (PCBs and IQ). This is an example approach using upstream biological perturbations for effect prediction.","<p>Place: Netherlands</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis on organochlorine pesticide | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no OCPs",10.1016/j.envres.2012.05.013,Humans;Male;Female;Infant;Pregnancy;Thyroid Gland;Child;Risk Assessment;Humanism;Humanities;Body Burden;Regression Analysis;Biological;Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects;Child Development/*drug effects;Intelligence Tests;Thyroid Hormones/*metabolism;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*toxicity;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*chemically induced;Fetus/metabolism;Intelligence/*drug effects;*Models,,

These methods have potential for application in pesticide risk assessments, but their applicability for assessing pesticide risks to soil invertebrate communities has not been evaluated. Using data obtained in a systematic review, the present study investigates the relevance of SSD and HC5 for predicting pesticide risks to soil invertebrates. Altogether, 1950 laboratory toxicity data were obtained, representing 250 pesticides and 67 invertebrate taxa. The majority (96%) of pesticides have toxicity data for fewer than five species. Based on a minimum of five species, the best available endpoint data (acute mortality median lethal concentration) enabled SSD and HC5 to be calculated for 11 pesticides (atrazine, carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, copper compounds, diazinon, dimethoate, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, lambda-cyhalothrin, parathion, pentachlorophenol, and propoxur). Arthropods and oligochaetes exhibit pronounced differences in their sensitivity to most of these pesticides. The standard test earthworm species, Eisenia fetida sensu lato, is the species that is least sensitive to insecticides based on acute mortality, whereas the standard Collembola test species, Folsomia candida, is among the most sensitive species for a broad range of toxic modes of action (biocide, fungicide, herbicide, and insecticide). These findings suggest that soil arthropods should be tested routinely in regulatory risk assessments. In addition, the data indicate that the uncertainty factor for earthworm acute mortality tests (i.e., 10) does not fully cover the range of earthworm species sensitivities and that acute mortality tests would not provide the most sensitive risk estimate for earthworms in the majority (95%) of cases.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: meta-analysis?,not conventional meta-analysis",,Pesticides;Animals;Species Specificity;Pesticides/*toxicity;Invertebrates/*drug effects;Soil/*analysis,,

An assessment of epidemiologic research on these pollutants identified in toxicologic studies can guide future research and exposure reduction aimed at prevention. The PubMed database was searched for relevant literature and systematic critical reviews were entered in a database available at URL: www.silentspring.org/sciencereview and URL: www. komen. org/ environment (accessed April 10, 2007). Based on a relatively small number of studies, the evidence to date generally supports an association between breast cancer and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in conjunction with certain genetic polymorphisms involved in carcinogen activation and steroid hormone metabolism. Evidence regarding dioxins and organic solvents is sparse and methodologically limited but suggestive of an association. Methodologic problems include inadequate exposure assessment, a lack of access to highly exposed and unexposed populations, and a lack of preclinical markers to identify associations that may be obscured by disease latency. Among chemicals identified in toxicologic research as relevant to breast cancer, many have not been investigated in humans. The development of better exposure assessment methods is needed to fill this gap. In the interim, weaknesses in the epidemiologic literature argue for greater reliance on toxicologic studies to develop national policies to reduce chemical exposures that may be associated with breast cancer. Substantial research progress in the last 5 years suggests that the investigation of environmental pollutants will lead to strategies to reduce breast cancer risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",10.1002/cncr.22655,Breast Neoplasms,,

The aim of the present study was to assess the role of EDCs in affecting risk of T2D and related metabolic traits. METHODS: MEDLINE was searched for cross-sectional and prospective studies published before 8 March 2014 into the association between EDCs (dioxin, polychlorinated biphenyl [PCB], chlorinated pesticide, bisphenol A [BPA], phthalate) and T2D and related metabolic traits. Three investigators independently extracted information on study design, participant characteristics, EDC types and concentrations, and association measures. RESULTS: Forty-one cross-sectional and eight prospective studies from ethnically diverse populations were included in the analysis. Serum concentrations of dioxins, PCBs, and chlorinated pesticides were significantly associated with T2D risk; comparing the highest to lowest concentration category, the pooled relative risks (RR) were 1.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44-2.54) for dioxins, 2.39 (95% CI 1.86-3.08) for total PCBs, and 2.30 (95% CI 1.81-2.93) for chlorinated pesticides. Urinary concentrations of BPA and phthalates were also associated with T2D risk; comparing the highest to lowest concentration categories, the pooled RR were 1.45 (95% CI 1.13-1.87) for BPA and 1.48 (95% CI 0.98-2.25) for phthalates. Further, EDC concentrations were associated with indicators of impaired fasting glucose and insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent and non-persistent EDCs may affect the risk of T2D. There is an urgent need for further investigation of EDCs, especially non-persistent ones, and T2D risk in large prospective studies.","<p>Place: Australia</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",10.1111/1753-0407.12325,Humans;Cross-Sectional Studies;Diabetes Mellitus;Prospective Studies;Risk Factors;*meta-analysis;*diabetes;Risk Assessment/methods;*bisphenol A;*endocrine-disrupting chemical;*meta分析;*phthalate;*内分泌干扰物;*双酚A;*糖尿病;*邻苯二甲酸盐;Benzhydryl Compounds/blood/urine;Dioxins/blood/urine;Endocrine Disruptors/*blood/poisoning/*urine;Phenols/blood/urine;Phthalic Acids/blood/urine;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/blood/urine;Type 2/*blood/chemically induced/*urine,,

The presented synopsis verifies the soil contamination by OCPs during the last several decades. Soil pollution by OCPs should be an essential aspect of the characterization of whole soil quality, considering that a significant percent of soils on a global scale are in the borderline of suitability for cultivation and pertinent activities.

DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE (1950-2009) and other electronic databases yielded 31 included studies. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently abstracted data and assessed the quality of each study. DATA SYNTHESIS: Random effects models were used to obtain summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). There was no overall association between childhood leukemia and any paternal occupational pesticide exposure (OR = 1.09; 95% CI, 0.88-1.34); there were slightly elevated risks in subgroups of studies with low total-quality scores (OR = 1.39; 95% CI, 0.99-1.95), ill-defined exposure time windows (OR = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.00-1.85), and exposure information collected after offspring leukemia diagnosis (OR = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.05-1.70). Childhood leukemia was associated with prenatal maternal occupational pesticide exposure (OR = 2.09; 95% CI, 1.51-2.88); this association was slightly stronger for studies with high exposure- measurementquality scores (OR = 2.45; 95% CI, 1.68-3.58), higher confounder control scores (OR = 2.38; 95% CI, 1.56-3.62), and farm-related exposures (OR = 2.44; 95% CI, 1.53-3.89). Childhood leukemia risk was also elevated for prenatal maternal occupational exposure to insecticides (OR = 2.72; 95% CI, 1.47-5.04) and herbicides (OR = 3.62; 95% CI, 1.28-10.3). CONCLUSIONS: Childhood leukemia was associated with prenatal maternal occupational pesticide exposure in analyses of all studies combined and in several subgroups.

OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the epidemiologic literature on the adverse effects of early-life exposure to POPs on respiratory health, allergy and the immune system in infancy, childhood and adolescence. METHODS: Based on published guidelines for systematic reviews, two independent researchers searched for published articles in MEDLINE and SCOPUS using defined keywords on POPs and respiratory health, immune function and allergy. Study eligibility criteria were defined to select the articles. RESULTS: This review of 41 studies finds limited evidence for prenatal exposure to DDE, PCBs and dioxins and risk of respiratory infections. Evidence was limited also for postnatal exposure to PCBs, specifically ndl-PCBs, and reduced immune response after vaccination in childhood. The review indicates lack of association between postnatal exposure to PCBs/ndl-PCBs and risk of asthma-related symptoms. For the other exposure-outcome associations reviewed evidence was inadequate. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Current epidemiological evidence suggests that early-life exposure to POPs can adversely influence immune and respiratory systems development. Heterogeneity between studies in exposure and outcome assessment and the small number of studies for any given exposure-outcome relationship currently make comparisons difficult and meta-analyses impossible. Also, mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Recommendations for significantly improving our understanding thus include harmonization of exposure and outcome assessment between studies, conduct of larger studies, long-term assessment of respiratory infections and asthma symptoms in order to identify critical periods of susceptibility, integration of the potential immunotoxic mechanisms of POPs, and use of new statistical tools to detangle the role of multiple exposures on multiple outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",,Humans;Immune System;Asthma/chemically induced/epidemiology;Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene/toxicity;Dioxins/toxicity;Hazardous Substances/*toxicity;Hypersensitivity/epidemiology;Immune System/*drug effects/growth & development;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/toxicity;Respiratory System/*drug effects/growth & development;Respiratory Tract Infections/chemically induced/epidemiology/immunology,,

Here, we link quantitative structure - activity relationships (QSARs) for response concentrations in water (LC50) to critical concentrations in organisms (C50) by a model for accumulation in lipid or non-lipid phases versus water Kpw. The model indicates that affinity for neutral body components such as storage fat yields steep Kpw-K ow relationships, whereas slopes for accumulation in polar phases such as proteins are gentle. This pattern is confirmed by LC50 QSARs for different modes of action, such as neutral versus polar narcotics and organochlorine versus organophosphor insecticides. LC50 QSARs were all between 0.00002 and 0.2Kow-1. After calibrating the model with the intercepts and, for the first time also, with the slopes of the LC50 QSARs, critical concentrations in organisms C50 are calculated and compared to an independent validation data set. About 60% of the variability in lethal body burdens C50 is explained by the model. Explanations for differences between estimated and measured levels for 11 modes of action are discussed. In particular, relationships between the critical concentrations in organisms C50 and chemical (Kow) or species (lipid content) characteristics are specified and tested.

OBJECTIVES: Investigate the association between pesticide exposure and CRC risk through a systematic literature review. METHODS: CRC has the fourth-highest rate of cancer-caused death in the US after lung cancer, breast cancer in women, and prostate cancer in men. Here we have conducted a systematic literature search on studies examining the association between any pesticide exposure and CRC risk using PubMed, MEDLINE via EBSCO host, and Embase according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. RESULTS: Following the review, 139 articles were included for qualitative evaluation. Study participants were farmers, pesticide applicators, pesticide manufacturers, spouses of pesticide applicators, farm residents, Korean veterans of the Vietnam War, rural communities, and those who consumed food with pesticide residues. The studies' results were split between those with significant positive (39 significant results) and inverse (41 significant results) associations when comparing pesticide exposure and CRC risk. DISCUSSION: From our literature review, we have identified a similar number of significant positive and inverse associations of pesticide exposure with CRC risk and therefore cannot conclude whether pesticide exposure has a positive or inverse association with CRC risk overall. However, certain pesticides such as terbufos, dicamba, trifluralin, S-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate (EPTC), imazethapyr, chlorpyrifos, carbaryl, pendimethalin, and acetochlor are of great concern not only for their associated elevated risk of CRC, but also for the current legal usage in the United States (US). Aldicarb and dieldrin are of moderate concern for the positive associations with CRC risk, and also for the illegal usage or the detection on imported food products even though they have been banned in the US. Pesticides can linger in the soil, water, and air for weeks to years and, therefore, can lead to exposure to farmers, manufacturing workers, and those living in rural communities near these farms and factories. Approximately 60 million people in the US live in rural areas and all of the CRC mortality hotspots are within the rural communities. The CRC mortality rate is still increasing in the rural regions despite the overall decreasing of incidence and mortality of CRC elsewhere. Therefore, the results from this study on the relationship between pesticide exposure and CRC risk will help us to understand CRC health disparities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",,Humans;Male;Pesticides;Female;Middle Aged;Adult;Colorectal Neoplasms;Incidence;Pesticides/*analysis;Colorectal Neoplasms/*epidemiology;Farmers/*statistics & numerical data;Herbicides/analysis;Occupational Exposure/analysis/*statistics & numerical data;Pesticide Residues/analysis,,

This present study conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the association between pesticide exposure and incidence of pancreatic cancer. Methods: Systematic searches of PubMed and Embase databases, up to October 2017, were conducted to identify relevant studies. Studies that reported relative estimates with 95% confidence intervals for association between pesticide exposure and pancreatic cancer risk were included. Fixed or random effects models were used to calculate summary risk estimates. Results: Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Comparing the highest with the lowest pesticide exposure, there was no association between pancreatic cancer incidence and pesticide exposure when all studies were analyzed (odds ratio [OR] = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.69-1.35). Significant heterogeneity was observed across these studies (P = 0.007, I-2 = 62.1%). Publication bias was revealed according to asymmetry of the Begg's funnel plot. Subgroup analysis showed that pesticide exposure was associated with a significant increased risk of pancreatic cancer in case-control studies (OR = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.13-1.93), but a decreased risk in prospective cohort studies (OR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.30-0.82). Conclusion: The present meta-analysis suggests no association between pesticide exposure and risk of pancreatic cancer. Further well-designed studies are warranted to confirm this association.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: type of pesticide: ""pesticide""......,table 1 has each of the pesticide studies,figure 2 has each of the pesticide studies,does not distinguish pesticides into chemical classes",,Pesticides;Pancreatic Neoplasms;Pancreatitis,,

Understanding the role of environmental chemicals in the development or progression of diabetes is an emerging issue in environmental health. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the epidemiologic literature for evidence of associations between persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Using a PubMed search and reference lists from relevant studies or review articles, we identified 72 epidemiological studies that investigated associations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) with diabetes. We evaluated these studies for consistency, strengths and weaknesses of study design (including power and statistical methods), clinical diagnosis, exposure assessment, study population characteristics, and identification of data gaps and areas for future research. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity of the studies precluded conducting a meta-analysis, but the overall evidence is sufficient for a positive association of some organochlorine POPs with type 2 diabetes. Collectively, these data are not sufficient to establish causality. Initial data mining revealed that the strongest positive correlation of diabetes with POPs occurred with organochlorine compounds, such as trans-nonachlor, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dioxins and dioxin-like chemicals. There is less indication of an association between other nonorganochlorine POPs, such as perfluoroalkyl acids and brominated compounds, and type 2 diabetes. Experimental data are needed to confirm the causality of these POPs, which will shed new light on the pathogenesis of diabetes. This new information should be considered by governmental bodies involved in the regulation of environmental contaminants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: meta-analysis?,no meta-analysis | USER-NOTES: {""Lorenzo""=>[""no overall mean""]}",,Humans;Hydrocarbons;Diabetes Mellitus;Animals;Rats;Mice;*Environmental Exposure;Environmental Pollutants/analysis/*toxicity;Obesity/chemically induced/epidemiology;Chlorinated/analysis/toxicity;Type 2/chemically induced/*epidemiology,,

Methods Studies were identified from a MEDLINE search through 31 July 2009 and from the reference lists of identified publications. Relative risk (RR) estimates were extracted from 25 studies published between 1985 and 2008. Meta-rate ratio estimates (mRR) were calculated according to fixed and random-effect meta-analysis models. Separate analyses were conducted after stratification for study design, definition of exposure (employment in a farm/agriculture assuming exposure to pesticides versus exposure to pesticides stipulated), exposed parent, window of exposure, type of leukaemia and biocide category. Results No statistically significant association between childhood leukaemia and parental occupation as farmers/ agricultural workers was observed. When exposure to pesticides was stipulated, positive associations were reported for maternal exposure for all studies combined (mRR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.22-2.16), in all exposure windows considered and for acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL). There was no association with paternal exposure when combining all studies (mRR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.76- 1.69). However, significant increased risks were seen for paternal exposure, in some exposure windows as well as for the biocide category. Conclusions The strongest evidence of an increased risk of childhood leukaemia comes from studies with maternal occupational exposure to pesticides. The associations with paternal exposure were weaker and less consistent. These results add to the evidence leading to recommend minimizing parental occupational exposure to pesticides. Our findings also support the need to rely more on studies that clearly stipulate exposure to pesticides rather than those that assume pesticide exposure because of farm/agriculture employment. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: are OCPs included?,figure 3 has each of the pesticides used,table 1 has each of the pesticide studies,table 2 has each of the pesticide studies,figure 2 has each of the pesticide studies,does not distinguish pesticides into chemical classes",10.1007/s10552-010-9516-7,Pesticides;Occupational Exposure,,

All kinds of ECs are on riserapidly in developing and industrializing low- and middle-income countries. The aquatic envi-ronments throughout the world are repositories for enormous amounts of ECs. As the biology ofthe reproductive system is highly conserved in vertebrates, wildlife or laboratory studies on fishprovide significant information to establish a detailed risk assessment, and to identify novel or moresensitive endpoints for ECs-related reproductive disorders. The adverse effects of ECs on endocrineregulation of reproduction in male fishes have been extensively studied and reviewed; however,our knowledge on the effects and mechanisms of action of ECs on determinants of male fertility islimited. The present study is a state-of-the-art comprehensive review on the ECs-related fertilitythreat in male fishes with emphasis on the ECs effects on sperm production, morphology, genome,and motility kinetics. After a brief introduction to reproductive biology, fertility indicators, anddeterminants of fertility in male fishes, wildlife evidences for reproductive disorders were reviewedin fishes from the polluted aquatic environment. The laboratory studies show that ECs detected inaquatic environment are capable of causing fertility threat at environmentally relevant concentrationsassociated with a decrease in fertility determinant(s). This study suggests an urgent need to betterelucidate mechanisms through which ECs affect sperm functions to cause fertility threat.Abstract:Increasing global rates of diminished fertility in males has been suggested to be associatedwith exposure to environmental contaminants (ECs). The aquatic environments are the final reposi-tory of ECs. As the reproductive system is conserved in vertebrates, studies on the effects of ECson fertility endpoints in fishes provide us with valuable information to establish biomarkers in riskassessment of ECs, and to understand the ECs-related fertility threat. The aim of the present reviewwas to evaluate associations between ECs and fertility determinants to better understand ECs-relatedmale fertility threat in male fishes. Wildlife studies show that the reproductive system has beenaffected in fishes sampled from the polluted aquatic environment. The laboratory studies show thepotency of ECs including natural and synthetic hormones, alkylphenols, bisphenols, plasticizers,pesticides, pharmaceutical, alkylating, and organotin agents to affect fertility determinants, resultingin diminished fertility at environmentally relevant concentrations. Both wildlife and laboratorystudies reveal that ECs adverse effects on male fertility are associated with a decrease in spermproduction, damage to sperm morphology, alternations in sperm genome, and decrease in spermmotility kinetics. The efficiency of ECs to affect sperm quality and male fertility highly dependson the concentration of the contaminants and the duration of exposure. Our review highlighs & nbsp;that the number of contaminants examined over fertility tests are much lower than the number ofcontaminants detected in our environment. The ECs effects on fertility are largely unknown whenfishes are exposed to the contaminants at early developmental stages. The review suggests the urgentneed to examine ECs effects on male fertility when a fish is exposed at different developmental stagesin a single or combination protocol. The ECs effects on the sperm genome are largely unknownto understand ECs-related inheritance of reproductive disorders transmitted to the progeny. Toelucidate modes of action of ECs on sperm motility, it is needed to study functional morphology ofthe motility apparatus and to investigate ECs-disrupted motility signaling.</p>","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",10.3390/ani11102817,Self-Fertilization,,

Methods: Following a systematic literature search, relative risks were extracted from 14 studies published between 1984 and 2004. Fixed effect analyses were carried out as heterogeneity between studies was not detected. Meta-analyses were performed on the whole set of data and separate analyses were conducted for specific chemical classes of pesticides as well as type of leukaemia. Results: The meta-rate ratio estimate for all studies was 1.43 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.94). After stratification by chemical class, consistent increases in the risk of leukaemia were found in all groups but statistical significance was found only for phenoxy herbicides unlikely to have been contaminated with dioxins and furans. This last finding appears equivocal in view of the existing literature. The separate analysis conducted on leukaemias from the myeloid lineage showed the highest relative risk (6.99; 95% CI 1.96-24.90). There was no obvious indication of publication bias. Conclusion: The overall meta-analysis among pesticide manufacturing workers provides quantitative evidence to consider occupational exposure to pesticides as a possible risk factor for leukaemia, but available data are too scarce for causality ascertainment. Epidemiological evidence did not allow identifying a specific pesticide or chemical class that would be responsible for the increased risk. Exposure to pesticides may be a significant risk factor for specifically developing myeloid leukaemia and there is a need for additional large well-conducted studies with clear definition of exposure and of leukaemia type(s).

rayyan-894980575,A systematic scoping review of the methodological approaches and effects of pesticide exposure on solitary bees,2021,1,1,,19326203,16,5,,,,,,,"Background Pollination services provided by solitary bees, the largest group of bees worldwide, are critical to the vitality of ecosystems and agricultural systems alike. Disconcertingly, bee populations are in decline, and while no single causative factor has been identified, pesticides are believed to play a role in downward population trends. The effects of pesticides on solitary bee species have not been previously systematically cataloged and reviewed. Objectives This systematic scoping review examines available evidence for effects of pesticide exposure on solitary bees to identify data gaps and priority research needs. Methods A systematic literature search strategy was developed to identify and document reports on solitary bee pesticide exposure-effects investigations. Literature was subsequently screened for relevance using a Population, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) statement and organized into a systematic evidence map. Investigations were organized by effect category (lethal effects on immatures, lethal effects on adults, sublethal effects on immatures, and sublethal effects on adults), species, pesticide class, and publication year. Results A comprehensive literature search of Web of Science and ProQuest Agricultural & Environmental Science supplemented by targeted internet searching and reference mining yielded 176 reports and publications for title and abstract screening and 65 that met PECO criteria (22 included lethal and 43 included sublethal effects endpoints). Relevant design details (pesticide, test compound configuration, study type, species, sex, exposure duration) were extracted into literature inventory tables to reveal the extent endpoints have been investigated and areas in need of additional research. Conclusions Evidence mapping revealed diversity in the pesticides and endpoints studied across the database. However, dilution across bee species, lack of complementary laboratory work and paucity of replicated investigations complicate efforts to interpret and apply available data to support pesticide risk assessment. © 2021 Public Library of Science.

Although the use of most POPs is banned in most countries, some organochlorine pesticides are still being used in several parts of the world. Although environmental levels of some POPs such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have declined, newly emerging POPs such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been increasing considerably. Exposure to POPs has been associated with a wide spectrum of effects including reproductive, developmental, immunologic, carcinogenic, and neurotoxic effects. It is of particular concern that neurotoxic effects of some POPs have been observed in humans at low environmental concentrations. This review focuses on PCBs as a representative chemical class of POPs and discusses the possible mode(s) of action for the neurotoxic effects with emphasis on comparing dose-response and structure-activity relationships (SAR) with other structurally related chemicals. There is sufficient epidemiological and experimental evidence showing that PCB exposure is associated with motor and cognitive deficits in humans and animal models. Although several potential mode(s) of actions were postulated for PCB-induced neurotoxic effects, changes in neurotransmitter systems, altered intracellular signalling processes, and thyroid hormone imbalance are predominant ones. These three potential mechanisms are discussed in detail in vitro and in vivo. In addition, SAR was conducted on other structurally similar chemicals to see if they have a common mode(s) of action. Relative potency factors for several of these POPs were calculated based on their effects on intracellular signalling processes. This is a comprehensive review comparing molecular effects at the cellular level to the neurotoxic effects seen in the whole animal for environmentally relevant POPs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",,character(0),,

We conducted an updated systematic review of the epidemiologic literature over the past decade on the relationship between pesticide exposure and PD, using the MEDLINE database. Despite methodological differences, a significantly increased PD risk was observed in 13 out of 23 case-control studies that considered overall exposure to pesticides (risk estimates of 1.1-2.4) and in 10 out of 12 studies using other research designs (risk estimates of 2 or higher). Various studies found stronger associations in genetically susceptible individuals. Among a growing number of studies on the effects of exposure to specific pesticides (n=20), an increased PD risk has been associated with insecticides, especially chlorpyrifos and organochlorines, in six studies (odds ratios of 1.8-4.4), and with the herbicide paraquat, the fungicide maneb or the combination of both. Findings considerably strengthen the evidence that exposure to pesticides in well water may contribute to PD, whereas studies of farming and rural residence found inconsistent or little association with the disease. Taken together, this comprehensive set of results suggests that the hypothesis of an association between pesticide exposure and PD cannot be ruled out. However, inadequate data on consistent responses to exposure hinder the establishment of a causal relationship with PD. Given the extensive worldwide use of many pesticides, further studies are warranted in larger populations that include detailed quantitative data on exposure and determination of genetic polymorphisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",,Humans;Pesticides;Environmental Exposure;Databases;Parkinson Disease;Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology;Parkinson Disease/*epidemiology/*etiology;Pesticides/*poisoning;Factual/statistics & numerical data,,

METHODS: Relevant studies from their inception to November 2021 were identified by searching EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. The cohort and case-control studies that reported effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of EDC exposure and GDM were selected. The heterogeneity among the included studies was quantified by I(2) statistic. Publication bias was evaluated through the Begg and Egger tests. RESULTS: Twenty-five articles with a total of 23,796 participants were found. Results indicated that exposure to PCBs has a significant influence on the incidence of GDM (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.00–1.31; n = 8). The risk of GDM was found to be associated with PBDE exposure (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.15-1.53; n = 4). PAEs and PFASs exposure were also positively associated with the risk of GDM, with summary ORs of 1.10 (95% CI = 1.03-1.16; n = 7 for PAEs) and 1.09 (95% CI = 1.02-1.16; n = 11 for PFASs), respectively. When only cohort studies were considered, the summary OR between PCBs exposure and the risk of GDM was 0.99 (95% CI = 0.91-1.09; n = 5). Meanwhile, the summary ORs from cohort studies for PBDEs, PAEs, and PFASs exposure were 1.12 (95% CI = 1.00-1.26; n = 2), 1.08 (95% CI = 1.02-1.15; n = 5), and 1.06 (95% CI = 1.00-1.12; n = 8), respectively. The Beggs and Egger tests did not show publication bias, and the sensitivity analyses did not change the results in this meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: These results support that exposure to certain EDCs, including PCBs, PBDEs, PAEs, and PFAS, increase the risk of GDM. Further large-sample epidemiologic researches and mechanistic studies are needed to verify the potential relationship and biological mechanisms. These results are of public health significance because the daily EDC exposure is expected to increase the risk of GDM development.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not organochlorine pesticide",10.1186/s12940-022-00858-8,"Humans;Meta-analysis;Female;Pregnancy;Diabetes;Systematic review;*Environmental Pollutants;*Diabetes;*Polychlorinated Biphenyls/toxicity;Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers/toxicity;*Endocrine Disruptors/adverse effects;*Fluorocarbons;Endocrine-disrupting chemical;Gestational diabetes mellitus;Risk factor;Gestational;Gestational/chemically induced/epidemiology;Diabetes, Gestational",,

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are a class of pollutants that are transported worldwide. Determining the impact of climate warming on the global cycling of POPs is important for understanding POP cycling processes and formulating relevant environmental policies. In this review, the main research findings in this field over the past ten years are summarized and the effects of climate warming on emissions, transport, storage, degradation and toxicity of POPs are reviewed. This review also summarizes the primary POP fate models and their application. Additionally, research gaps and future research directions are identified and suggested. Under the influence of climate change, global cycling of POPs mainly shows the following responses. (1) Global warming directly promotes the secondary emission of POPs; for example, temperature rise will cause POPs to be re-released from soils and oceans, and melting glaciers and permafrost can re-release POPs into freshwater ecosystems. (2) Global extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, result in the redistribution of POPs through intense soil erosion. (3) The changes in atmospheric circulation and ocean currents have significantly influenced the global transport of POPs. (4) Climate warming has altered marine biological productivity, which has changed the POP storage capacity of the ocean. (5) Aquatic and terrestrial food-chain structures have undergone significant changes, which could lead to amplification of POP toxicity in ecosystems. (6) Overall, warming accelerates the POP volatilization process and increases the amount of POPs in the environment, although global warming facilitates their degradation at the same time. (7) Various models have predicted the future environmental behaviors of POPs. These models are used to assist governments in comprehensively considering the impact of global warming on the environmental fate of POPs and therefore controlling POPs effectively. Future studies should focus on the synergistic effects of global changes on the cycling of POPs. Additionally, the interactions among global carbon cycling, water cycling and POP cycling will be a new research direction for better understanding the adaptation of ecosystems to climate change.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a meta-analysis",10.1007/s11430-016-5073-0,character(0),,

Besides environmental persistence, biomagnification and bioaccumulative properties, these pollutants are classified as endocrine disruptors (EDs), metabolic disruptors, neurologic disruptors. These compounds affect the normal function of several mechanisms in the human body being linked to human health issues as cancer development (e.g. breast, uterine and endometrial), miscarriage, birth defects, premature delivery and infertility.

OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies examining the relationship between occupational exposures and FL risk. METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, and Web of Science for eligible observational studies examining job titles or occupational exposures prior to January 1, 2020. We performed a narrative synthesis and used random-effects models to generate meta-estimates of relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for exposures reported by three or more studies. RESULTS: Fifty-eight studies were eligible. Ten cohort and 37 case-control studies quantified FL risk in relation to any exposure to one or more occupational groups or agents. Eight cohort and 19 case-control studies examined dose-response relationships. We found evidence of a positive association with increasing plasma concentration of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE; meta-RR = 1.51, 95%CI = 0.99, 2.31; I(2) = 0.0%) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs; meta-RR = 1.47, 95%CI = 0.97, 2.24; I(2) = 8.6%). We observed a positive association with exposure to any solvent (meta-RR = 1.16, 95%CI = 1.00, 1.34; I(2) = 0.0%) and chlorinated solvents (meta-RR = 1.35, 95%CI = 1.09, 1.68; I(2) = 0.0%). Single studies reported a significant positive dose-response association for exposure to any pesticide, hexachlorobenzene, any organophosphate, diazinon, metolachlor, carbaryl, lindane, trichloroethylene, oils/greases, and extremely low-frequency magnetic fields. Job title-only analyses suggested increased risk for medical doctors and spray painters, and decreased risk for bakers and teachers. Overall, studies demonstrated low risk of bias, but most studies examined small numbers of exposed cases. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence indicates a positive association between FL and occupational exposure to DDE, PCBs, any solvent and chlorinated solvents. Our findings may help guide policies and practices on the safe use of solvents and inform models of lymphomagenesis. Future studies with larger sample sizes and comprehensive quantitative exposure measures may elucidate other avoidable carcinogenic exposures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",,Humans;Cohort Studies;Lymphoma;Occupational Exposure;Solvents;*Occupational Exposure/adverse effects;*Lymphoma;Follicular/chemically induced/epidemiology;Non-Hodgkin/chemically induced/epidemiology,,

Based on a systematic review, we identified 136 relevant papers focusing on soil contamination from hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in China (published from 2001 to 2019). We compiled scientific data, extracted and analyzed relevant information, and summarized the pollution characteristics of HCH and DDT in Chinese soils found in two land use types: agricultural land and land for construction. Related studies on HCH and DDT in Chinese soils focus on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas, where agricultural soils are predominant. The average concentrations of both HCH and DDT in agricultural soils were generally lower than the risk screening value (100 μg/kg) in most provinces in China, except for DDT concentrations in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. However, in certain central and eastern regions, mean or maximum recorded DDT concentrations approaching or exceeding 100 μg/kg were recorded. Regarding land for construction, soils with excessive concentrations of HCH and DDT were primarily observed at sites of operational or defunct pesticide factories. According to isomer and metabolite compositions, HCH and DDT at most sites originated from historical residues, but others may have been new inputs after 1983. Since 2015, the concentrations of HCH and DDT in agricultural soils in China have been decreasing, and those in the soils of land for construction (except for sites of operational or defunct pesticide factories) have not exceeded the standard after 2005. This indicates that the measures to prohibit the production and use of OCPs in China have been effective. However, the management of operational or defunct pesticide factories polluted by OCPs requires further improvement.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: meta-analysis?,no meta-analysis,not conventional meta-analysis | USER-NOTES: {""Lorenzo""=>[""Fig.3: \""Temporal distribution of HCH and DDT concentrations in soils of (a) agricultural land and (b) land for construction in China based on our literature review\""""]}",,Lindane,,

Methods: Two cohort and 38 caseecontrol studies were selected for the first meta-analysis. After evaluating homogeneity among studies using the Cochran Q test, the authors calculated a pooled meta-OR stratified on each cancer site. The authors then constructed a list of variables believed to play an important role in explaining the relation between parental exposure to pesticide and childhood cancer, and performed a series of meta-analyses. The authors also performed a distinct meta-analysis for three cohort studies with RR data. Results: Meta-analysis of the three cohort studies did not show any positive links between parental pesticide exposure and childhood cancer incidence. However, the meta-analysis of the 40 studies with OR values showed that the risk of lymphoma and leukaemia increased significantly in exposed children when their mother was exposed during the prenatal period (OR=1.53; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.91 and OR=1.48; 95% CI 1.26 to 1.75). The risk of brain cancer was correlated with paternal exposure either before or after birth (OR=1.49; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.79 and OR=1.66; 95% CI 1.11 to 2.49). The OR of leukaemia and lymphoma was higher when the mother was exposed to pesticides (through household use or professional exposure). Conversely, the incidence of brain cancer was influenced by the father's exposure (occupational activity or use of household or garden pesticides). Conclusion: Despite some limitations in this study, the incidence of childhood cancer does appear to be associated with parental exposure during the prenatal period.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: are OCPs included?,figure 3 has each of the pesticides used,figure 2 has each of the pesticide studies,does not distinguish pesticides into chemical classes",10.1136/oemed-2011-100082,Pesticides,,

Methods: Systematic review of pertinent literature. Results: DLCs have been the most investigated ETs. DLCs are persistent organic pollutants with highly toxic potential and include three types of compounds: polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) or furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The most toxic is 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The connection mechanism between dioxins and endometriosis is still unclear. However, dioxins and DLCs are endocrine-disrupting compounds that can affect the pathobiology of endometriosis at multiple levels. Part of the dioxin and DLCs toxic effects can be accounted for by their interaction with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). It has been proposed that dioxin can initiate or promote endometriosis by means of interaction with estrogen receptors or by suppressing the expression of progesterone receptors. Furthermore, TCDD alters the expression of cytokines and growth factors, remodeling enzymes and cytochrome P450 expression and activity. Conclusions: Studies in rhesus models have revealed a correlation between dioxin exposure and endometriosis.

SUMMARY ANSWER: There is an association between maternal occupational exposure to solvents and congenital anomalies in the offspring, including neural tube defects, congenital heart defects and orofacial clefts. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: One important environmental risk factor for development of congenital anomalies is maternal occupational exposure to chemicals in the workplace prior to and during pregnancy. A number of studies have assessed the association with often conflicting results, possibly due to different occupational exposure assessing methods. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: For this systematic review with meta-analysis, the search terms included maternal occupation, exposure, congenital anomalies and offspring. Electronic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for English studies up to October 2017. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened all citations identified by the search. Case-control studies and cohort studies were included if (I) they reported on the association between maternal occupational exposure to solvents, pesticides or metals and congenital anomalies, and (II) assessment of occupational exposure was performed by experts. Data on study characteristics, confounders and odds ratios (ORs) were extracted from the included studies for four subgroups of congenital anomalies. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. In the meta-analysis, random effects models were used to pool estimates. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In total, 2806 titles and abstracts and 176 full text papers were screened. Finally, 28 studies met the selection criteria, and 27 studies could be included in the meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that maternal occupational exposure to solvents was associated with neural tube defects (OR: 1.51, 95%CI: 1.09-2.09) and congenital heart defects (OR: 1.31, 95%CI:1.06-1.63) in the offspring. Also maternal occupational exposure to glycol ethers, a subgroup of solvents, was associated with neural tube defects (OR: 1.93, 95%CI: 1.17-3.18) and orofacial clefts (OR: 1.95, 95%CI: 1.38-2.75) in the offspring. Only one study investigated the association between maternal occupational exposure to solvents and hypospadias and found an association (OR: 3.63, 95%CI: 1.94-7.17). Results of the included studies were consistent. In our meta-analysis, we found no associations between occupational exposure to pesticides or metals and congenital anomalies in the offspring. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: A limited number of studies was included, which made it impossible to calculate pooled estimates for all congenital anomalies, analyse individual chemicals or calculate exposure-response relations. Bias could have been introduced because not all included studies corrected for potentially confounding factors. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Employers and female employees should be aware of the possible teratogenic effects of solvent exposure at the workplace. Therefore, is it important that clinicians and occupational health specialist provide women with preconception advice on occupational solvent exposure, to reduce the congenital anomaly risk.

Performing a systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and ScienceDirect were searched for studies reporting the risk of MetS following pesticides exposure and their contaminants. We included 12 studies for a total of 6789 participants, in which 1981 (29.1%) had a MetS. Overall exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk of MetS by 30% (95CI 22%-37%). Overall organochlorine increased the risk of MetS by 23% (14-32%), as well as for most types of organochlorines: hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk by 53% (28-78%), hexachlorobenzene by 40% (0.01-80%), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene by 22% (9-34%), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane by 28% (5-50%), oxychlordane by 24% (1-47%), and transnonchlor by 35% (19-52%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed that overall exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk by 46% (35-56%) using crude data or by 19% (10-29%) using fully-adjusted model. The risk for overall pesticides and types of pesticides was also significant with crude data but only for hexachlorocyclohexane (36% risk increase, 17-55%) and transnonchlor (25% risk increase, 3-48%) with fully-adjusted models. Metaregressions demonstrated that hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk of MetS in comparison to most other pesticides. The risk increased for more recent periods (Coefficient = 0.28, 95CI 0.20 to 0.37, by year). We demonstrated an inverse relationship with body mass index and male gender. In conclusion, pesticides exposure is a major risk factor for MetS. Besides organochlorine exposure, data are lacking for other types of pesticides. The risk increased with time, reflecting a probable increase of the use of pesticides worldwide. The inverse relationship with body mass index may signify a stockage of pesticides and contaminants in fat tissue.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",,Chlorinated;DDT;Hexachlorocyclohexane;Humans;Male;Pesticides;*Pesticides;*Metabolic Syndrome/chemically induced/epidemiology;*Hydrocarbons,,

This review analyzed epidemiologic studies testing the hypothesis that exposure to pesticides during pregnancy and/or early childhood is associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. Studies that directly queried pesticide exposure (e.g., via questionnaire or interview) or measured pesticide or metabolite levels in biological specimens from study participants (e.g., blood, urine, etc.) or their immediate environment (e.g., personal air monitoring, home dust samples, etc.) were eligible for inclusion. Consistency, strength of association, and dose response were key elements of the framework utilized for evaluating epidemiologic studies. As a whole, the epidemiologic studies did not strongly implicate any particular pesticide as being causally related to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants and children. A few associations were unique for a health outcome and specific pesticide, and alternative hypotheses could not be ruled out. Our survey of the in vivo peer-reviewed published mammalian literature focused on effects of the specific active ingredient of pesticides on functional neurodevelopmental endpoints (i.e., behavior, neuropharmacology and neuropathology). In most cases, effects were noted at dose levels within the same order of magnitude or higher compared to the point of departure used for chronic risk assessments in the United States. Thus, although the published animal studies may have characterized potential neurodevelopmental outcomes using endpoints not required by guideline studies, the effects were generally observed at or above effect levels measured in repeated-dose toxicology studies submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Suggestions for improved exposure assessment in epidemiology studies and more effective and tiered approaches in animal testing are discussed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",,Humans;Hydrocarbons;Male;Pesticides;Animals;Female;Infant;Pregnancy;Child;Preschool;Dose-Response Relationship;Drug;United States;Mammals;Evidence-Based Medicine;Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects;Pesticides/*toxicity;Aryldialkylphosphatase/metabolism;Child Development/*drug effects;DDT/poisoning;Developmental Disabilities/*chemically induced/*epidemiology;Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene/poisoning;Evaluation Studies as Topic;Insecticides/toxicity;Intelligence Tests;Intelligence/drug effects;Learning/drug effects;Memory/drug effects;Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced/*epidemiology;Neurotoxicity Syndromes/epidemiology/etiology;Organophosphate Poisoning/etiology;Organophosphates/*toxicity;Pyrethrins/*toxicity;United States Environmental Protection Agency;Animal Shells;Chlorinated/*toxicity,,

Our study aimed at summarising the environmental risk factors for ALS, assessing the evidence for diverse biases, and pinpointing risk factors with high epidemiological credibility. Methods: We searched PubMed from inception to August 20, 2015, to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies examining associations between environmental factors and ALS. For each meta-analysis, we estimated the summary effect size by the use of random-effects and fixed-effects models, the 95% CI, the 95% prediction interval (PI), and the between-study heterogeneity. We assessed the evidence of small-study effects and excess significance bias. Results: Sixteen unique meta-analyses of different risk factors and ALS were considered. Of them, 5 were statistically significant at p < 0.001 under the random-effects model. Only one factor presented robust evidence for a convincing association. This association pertained to chronic occupational exposure to lead (random-effects OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.39-2.35). Conclusions: A small number of published meta-analyses on environmental factors and risk of ALS was identified, a phenomenon that could be attributed to the challenges in studying a rare neurological disease.

As the modes of action for pesticides are not species-specific, concerns have been raised about environmental risks associated with their exposure through various routes (e.g., residues in food and drinking water). Although such hazards range from short-term (e.g., skin and eye irritation, headaches, dizziness, and nausea) to chronic impacts (e.g., cancer, asthma, and diabetes), their risks are difficult to elucidate due to the involvement of various factors (e.g., period and level of exposure, type of pesticide (regarding toxicity and persistence), and the environmental characteristics of the affected areas). There are no groups in the human population that are completely unexposed to pesticides while most diseases are multi-causal to add considerable complexity to public health assessments. Hence, development of eco-friendly pesticide alternatives (e.g., EcoSMART) and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques is desirable to reduce the impacts of pesticides. This paper was hence organized to present a comprehensive review on pesticides with respect to their types, environmental distribution, routes of exposure, and health impacts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Information from recently published temporal trend studies was tabulated and comparisons were also drawn with trends in arctic air. Most of the analysed time-series of legacy POP compounds showed decreasing trends, with only a few time-series showing significantly increasing trends. Compounds such as alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH and SigmaDDT had a relatively high proportion of time-series showing significantly decreasing trends; SigmaCHL had the lowest proportion. beta-HCH was an exception, where long-range transport through the ocean, and not the atmosphere, may explain several increasing trends that were detected in the Canadian Arctic. Moving east from the Canadian Arctic there was a trend towards a greater proportion of significantly decreasing trends. Several time-series for DDE and SigmaDDT showed significantly non-exponential trends, most often with a period of relative stability followed by a decrease. The median 'minimum detectable annual change within a 10-year period' for all of the time-series considered was 12% which did not meet the desirable level of statistical power capable of detecting a 5% annual change with a significance level of 5% within a 10-year period. The trends observed in the biota were consistent with decreasing trends of legacy POPs reported for Arctic air which appear to follow historic decreases in emissions. However, recent decreases in air are also starting to show signs of levelling off which may be an indication that atmospheric concentrations and, consequently those in the biota, are being less driven by primary sources and more by environmental processes and degradation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",,Time;Environmental Pollution/statistics & numerical data;*Environmental Monitoring;Chlordan/analysis;Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene/analysis;Dieldrin/analysis;Environmental Pollutants/analysis/*metabolism;Heptachlor Epoxide/analysis;Hexachlorobenzene/analysis;Hexachlorocyclohexane/analysis;Mirex/analysis;Organic Chemicals/analysis/*metabolism;Toxaphene/analysis,,

This paper reviews and updates knowledge of spatial and temporal trends of Cd, Hg and organochlorines (PCBs, DDTs, HCHs, HCB and chlordane-related compounds) in Greenland terrestrial, freshwater and marine biota. The most comprehensive studies of spatial trends of Cd and Hg in the terrestrial ecosystem concern lichens, with relatively complete coverage, and caribou (Rangifer tarandus), with coverage mainly in different regions of central West Greenland and Southwest Greenland. The Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) is the only freshwater organism for which studies of spatial trends of Hg levels have been completed. Information on spatial trends of Cd and Hg in the marine environment is available from studies of fish, seabirds, ringed seals (Phoca hispida) and polar bears (Ursus maritimus). Geographical patterns of Cd and Hg in Greenland biota were not always consistent among different species or different studies. In landlocked Arctic char the concentrations of Hg decreased from south to north. In marine animals levels of Hg tended to be higher in East Greenland than in West Greenland and Cd levels were highest in biota from Disko Island in central West Greenland. The observed regional differences are difficult to explain but in most cases the causes appear to be natural rather than anthropogenic. Only a few time series covering the last 20 years exist for Cd and Hg. The one time series indicating a temporal change is for ringed seals in Northwest Greenland, which shows an increasing trend of Hg and a decreasing trend of Cd since 1984. Whether the changes reflect anthropogenic inputs, seal behaviour or other environmental factors is unknown. The most significant new insights have concerned organochlorines. In general, levels of these compounds were very low in terrestrial biota compared to marine species. Concentrations in landlocked Arctic char were highest in Southeast Greenland and lowest in Northwest and Northeast Greenland. Marine species from East Greenland had consistently higher levels of SigmaPCB, SigmaDDT and SigmaHCH than marine species from West Greenland. Very few data exist to evaluate temporal changes of organochlorine levels in Greenland biota, and this is the most significant knowledge gap at present. The most pronounced change observed was a decrease of 78% in SigmaPCB levels in polar bears from East Greenland from 1990 to 2000. Levels of SigmaHCH in shorthorn sculpins (Myoxocephalus scorpius) and seals from both central West Greenland and central East Greenland appear to have decreased since 1994. Increasing trends of SigmaDDT from 1994 until now were found in both sexes of seals as well as in male sculpins from central West Greenland.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not conventional meta-analysis",,Animals;Environmental Monitoring;Metals;Seawater;Tissue Distribution;Fresh Water;Ursidae;Greenland;Environmental Pollutants/*analysis;Insecticides/*analysis;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*analysis;*Food Chain;Deer;Heavy/*analysis;Seals;Earless,,

We reviewed currently available data to determine the extent to which recent studies assist in distinguishing the effect of pentachlorophenol from that of its contaminants (e.g., dioxins and other chlorophenols). DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: We performed a systematic review of published studies pertaining to cancer risk in relation to pentachlorophenol exposure, focusing on results pertaining specifically to all cancer sites and specific hematopoietic cancers, and data pertaining to risks associated with other types of chlorophenols, dioxins, or furans. SYNTHESIS: The pentachlorophenol studies presented considerable evidence pertaining to hematopoietic cancers, with strong associations seen in multiple studies, in different locations, and using different designs. There is little evidence of an association between these cancers and chlorophenols that contain fewer than four chlorines. The extension of a large cohort study of sawmill workers, with follow-up to 1995, provided information about risks of relatively rare cancers (e.g., non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma), using a validated exposure assessment procedure that distinguishes between exposures to pentachlorophenol and tetrachlorophenol. In contrast with dioxin, pentachlorophenol exposure has not been associated with total cancer incidence or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The updated cohort study focusing on pentachlorophenol provides increased statistical power and precision, and demonstrates associations between hematopoietic cancer and pentachlorophenol exposure not observed in earlier evaluations of this cohort. Contaminant confounding is an unlikely explanation for the risks seen with pentachlorophenol exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",,Humans;Male;Cohort Studies;Female;Child;Middle Aged;Adult;Aged;Environmental Exposure;Case-Control Studies;Pentachlorophenol;Risk Assessment;Fungicides;Incidence;Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology;Carcinogens/*toxicity;Chlorophenols/*toxicity;Dioxins/*toxicity;Pentachlorophenol/*toxicity;Industrial/*toxicity;80;over,,

In our study, we aimed to perform a systematic search of environmental risk factors for BD. In addition, we assessed possible hints of bias in this literature, and identified risk factors supported by high epidemiological credibility. Methods: We searched the Pubmed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycInfo databases up to 7 October 2016 to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies that assessed associations between putative environmental risk factors and BD. For each meta-analysis, we estimated its summary effect size by means of both random- and fixed-effects models, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), the 95% prediction interval, and heterogeneity. Evidence of small-study effects and excess of significance bias was also assessed. Results: Sixteen publications met the inclusion criteria (seven meta-analyses and nine qualitative systematic reviews). Fifty-one unique environmental risk factors for BD were evaluated. Six meta-analyses investigated associations with a risk factor for BD. Only irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) emerged as a risk factor for BD supported by convincing evidence (k=6; odds ratio [OR]=2.48; 95% CI=2.35−2.61; P<.001), and childhood adversity was supported by highly suggestive evidence. Asthma and obesity were risk factors for BD supported by suggestive evidence, and seropositivity to Toxoplasma gondii and a history of head injury were supported by weak evidence. Conclusions: Notwithstanding that several environmental risk factors for BD were identified, few meta-analyses of observational studies were available. Therefore, further well-designed and adequately powered studies are necessary to map the environmental risk factors for BD. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Primary and secondary review of epidemiological studies on the importance of atmospheric air pollutants and chemical pesticides for the development of diabetes mellitus is presented. Material and methods. The article includes reviews using the ISI-Web of Science, EMBASE and PubMed database for systematic review and meta-analysis, and original studies from PubMed and RISC until March 2018 to assess the cause-effect relationships of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with air pollutants and chemical pesticides. Results. Chemical pollution is considered as a new risk factor for insulin resistance and development of CD2, although the number of publications is limited, and the degree of validity of the findings is very wide. The evidence base for the effect on the incidence of diabetes type 2 is the most complete for organochlorine pesticides (DDT, DDE, HCH) and persistent organic pollutants, which are impurities of the commodity forms of individual preparations. It is supported by systematic reviews, meta-analysis, survey results, the content of active ingredients in biomaterial, risk calculations. Data for assessing the interrelationships of diabetes and glyphosates, chlorophenoxyacetates, pyrethroids and other pesticides widely used in the last two decades are insufficient for statistical generalizations. Intermediate position on the degree of evidence of diabetogenic properties occupies air pollutants (PM2,5, PM10, NO2). The role of the genetic component, obesity, metabolic disorders for the incidence of diabetes in conditions of technogenic pollution is discussed. Conclusion. Targeted epidemiological studies are needed on the environmental risks associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus caused by air pollutants and pesticides used at this stage for the organization of preventive measures. © 2019 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

Experimental studies demonstrated that POPs can cause and promote growth of breast cancer. However, inconsistent results from epidemiological studies do not support a causal relationship between POPs and breast cancer in women. To identify individual POPs that are repeatedly found to be associated with both breast cancer incidence and progression, and to demystify the observed inconsistencies between epidemiological studies, we conducted a systematic review of 95 studies retrieved from three main electronic databases. While no clear pattern of associations between blood POPs and breast cancer incidence could be drawn, POPs measured in breast adipose tissue were more clearly associated with higher breast cancer incidence. POPs were more consistently associated with worse breast cancer prognosis whether measured in blood or breast adipose tissue. In contrast, POPs measured in adipose tissue other than breast were inversely associated with both breast cancer incidence and prognosis. Differences in biological tissues used for POPs measurement and methodological biases explain the discrepancies between studies results. Some individual compounds associated with both breast cancer incidence and progression, deserve further investigation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",10.3390/cancers11081063,Breast Neoplasms,,

OP and CB act as acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors that affect lots of organs such as peripheral and central nervous systems, muscles, liver, pancreas, and brain, whereas OC are neurotoxic involved in alteration of ion channels. There are several reports about metabolic disorders, hyperglycemia, and also oxidative stress in acute and chronic exposures to pesticides that are linked with diabetes and other metabolic disorders. In this respect, there are several in vitro and in vivo but few clinical studies about mechanism underlying these effects. Bibliographic databases were searched for the years 1963-2010 and resulted in 1652 articles. After elimination of duplicates or irrelevant papers, 204 papers were included and reviewed. Results indicated that OP and CB impair the enzymatic pathways involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and protein within cytoplasm, mitochondria, and proxisomes. It is believed that OP and CB show this effect through inhibition of AChE or affecting target organs directly. OC mostly affect lipid metabolism in the adipose tissues and change glucose pathway in other cells. As a shared mechanism, all OP, CB and OC induce cellular oxidative stress via affecting mitochondrial function and therefore disrupt neuronal and hormonal status of the body. Establishing proper epidemiological studies to explore exact relationships between exposure levels to these pesticides and rate of resulted metabolic disorders in human will be helpful.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",,Humans;Hydrocarbons;Pesticides;Animals;Bibliographic;Databases;Carbamates;Pesticides/*toxicity;Oxidative Stress/drug effects;Carbamates/toxicity;Organophosphates/toxicity;Carbohydrate Metabolism/*drug effects;Lipid Metabolism/*drug effects;Metabolic Diseases/*chemically induced/metabolism/pathology;Proteins/*metabolism;Chlorinated/toxicity,,

METHODS: We performed a systematic review to identify established and proposed environmental factors associated with colorectal cancer incidence, created an assessment questionnaire tool regarding these environmental exposures, and applied this questionnaire among 114 participants from the communities of Timiskaming and Peel. RESULTS: We found that tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, residential use of organochlorine pesticides, and potential exposure to toxic metals were dominant factors among Timiskaming respondents. We found significant differences regarding active smoking, chronic alcohol use, reported indoor and outdoor household pesticide use, and gold and silver mining in the Timiskaming region. CONCLUSIONS: This study, the first to assess environmental factors in the Timiskaming community, identified higher reported exposures to tobacco, alcohol, pesticides, and mining in Timiskaming when compared with Peel.

They cause a range of adverse effects to human health and the environment around the world. There is growing concern that POPs may increase breast cancer risk due to their xenoestrogenic properties. The aim of this systematic literature review is to summarize and integrate the risks of breast cancer following environmental exposure to POPs (other than DDT) from primary epidemiological studies published between 2006 and 2015. After searching various databases, 14 case-control studies and one cohort study were included. Evidence of an association between increased breast cancer risk and environmental exposure to these chemicals is inconsistent and inadequate to conclude with certainty. However, most of the studies have examined exposure to the pollutants after diagnosis of breast cancer, overlooking exposure during critical windows of vulnerability. They have also largely focused on individual chemicals but ignored the combined effects of different chemicals. Therefore, major data gaps remain in examining exposure during critical windows of vulnerability and assessing combined effects of multiple chemicals. Development of better exposure assessment methods addressing these gaps is required for future research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",,Humans;Female;Breast Neoplasms;Organic Chemicals;Neoplasms;Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects;Breast Neoplasms/*chemically induced;Environmental Pollutants/chemistry/*toxicity,,

Results suggest that exposure to pesticides may be associated with prevalent asthma, but methodological issues, such as cross-sectional/case-control design, measurements of exposure and limited adjustment for confounders, limit the strength of the evidence base in this area. The association between pesticide exposure and asthma appears to be more evident and consistent in children than in adults. Exposure to pesticides may be associated with COPD; however, the strength of evidence for an association with COPD is weaker than for asthma.

Fipronil, a phenylpyrazoles insecticide, is one of the most widely used, systemic, broad-spectrum insecticides. Owing to its unique mode of action and selective toxicity, it was once regarded as safer alternatives to more toxic and persistent organochlorine insecticides. However, with the increased use, many studies have reported the toxicity of fipronil and its metabolites in various non-target organisms during the last two decades. Currently, it is regarded as one of the most persistent and lipophilic insecticides in the market. In the environment, fipronil can undergo oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, or photolysis to form fipronil sulfone, fipronil sulfide, fipronil amide, or fipronil desulfinyl respectively. These metabolites except fipronil amide are more or less toxic and persistent than fipronil and have been reported from diverse environmental samples. Recently many studies have focused on the degradation and removal of fipronil residues from the environment. However, a comprehensive review summarizing and combining these recent findings is lacking.

It has been more than a decade since Byrne and colleagues reported enhanced absorption of nutrients, improved weight gain, and reduction in parenteral nutrition requirements with the administration of a combination of human growth hormone (HGH) and glutamine in patients with short bowel syndrome. Other studies have reported inconsistent results. Objectives The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of growth hormone with or without glutamine supplementation for adult patients with short bowel syndrome. Search methods Electronic searches were performed to identify all publications describing randomised controlled trials of the use of human growth hormone with or without glutamine for the treatment of patients with short bowel syndrome. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of human growth hormone with or without glutamine for patients with short bowel syndrome were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data from the published studies. The statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5 software. Follmann's method was used for cross‐over studies. Main results Five studies were included in the review. Human growth hormone with or without glutamine appears to provide benefit in terms of increased weight (MD 1.66 Kg; 95% CI 0.69 to 2.63;P = 0.0008), lean body mass (MD 1.93 Kg; 95% CI 0.97 to 2.90; P = 0.0001) energy absorption (MD 4.42 Kcal; 95% CI 0.26 to 8.58; P = 0.04) and nitrogen absorption (MD 44.85 g; 95%CI 0.20 to 9.49; P = 0.04) for patients with short bowel syndrome. The single RCT that focused on parenteral nutrition (PN) requirements demonstrated decreased PN volume and calories and number of infusions in patients who received HGH with or without glutamine supplementation. Only patients who received HGH with glutamine maintained statistically significant PN reductions at 3 month follow‐up. Authors' conclusions The results suggest a positive effect of human growth hormone on weight gain and energy absorption. However, in the majority of trials, the effects are short‐lived returning to baseline shortly after cessation of therapy. The temporary benefit calls into question the clinical utility of this treatment. To date, the evidence is inconclusive to recommend this therapy. Consideration should be made to studying patients during the active phase of intestinal adaptation rather than in the setting of chronic intestinal failure. The role of HGH in paediatric short bowel syndrome remains unknown. Plain language summary Human growth hormone and glutamine for patients with short bowel syndrome Short bowel syndrome is a malabsorption disorder caused by the surgical removal of the small intestine, or by the complete dysfunction of a large segment of bowel. It is a challenging health problem to treat. Several small studies have assessed the benefit of providing drugs such as human growth hormone and glutamine in an attempt to improve intestinal function and wean intravenous nutrition (liquid food). The results of this review of 5 small studies suggest that human growth hormone used with or without glutamine may provide short term benefit for patients with short bowel syndrome in terms of weight gain and intestinal absorption of nutrients. However the benefits of treatment do not continue after treatment is stopped.

Contradicting published results regarding the relationship between body burden levels of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (p,p'-DDE)–the main DDT metabolite–and breast cancer, we argue that such differences stem from methodologic differences among those studies. We performed a meta-analysis of 22 articles using DerSimonian and Laird's method for random effects models. The Q-statistic was used to identify heterogeneity in the outcome variable across studies. The gradient of p,p'-DDE exposure in epidemiologic studies was homogenized to serum lipid bases (nanograms per gram). The potential for publication bias was examined by means of the Begg's test. We discuss methodologic features of the studies in an attempt to reconcile the findings. The summary odds ratio (OR) for selected studies was 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.87-1.09) and the gradient of exposure ranged from 84.37 to 12,948 ng/g. No overall heterogeneity in the OR was observed (chi-squared = 27.93; df = 23; p = 0.218). Neither the study design nor the lack of breast-feeding control or the type of biologic specimen used to measure p,p'-DDE levels were the causes of heterogeneity throughout the studies. Evidence for publication bias was not found (p = 0.253). Overall, these results should be regarded as a strong evidence to discard the putative relationship between p,p'-DDE and breast cancer risk. Nevertheless, the exposure to DDT during critical periods of human development–from conception to adolescence–and individual variations in metabolizing enzymes of DDT or its derivatives are still important areas to be researched in regard to breast cancer development in adulthood.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",,Humans;Female;Infant;Newborn;Pregnancy;Child;Preschool;Adult;Epidemiologic Studies;Research Design;Reproducibility of Results;Risk Assessment;Breast Neoplasms;Tissue Distribution;Odds Ratio;*Environmental Exposure;*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects;Adolescent/physiology;Breast Neoplasms/*chemically induced/*epidemiology;DDT/*pharmacokinetics/*poisoning;Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene/*pharmacokinetics/*poisoning;Environmental Pollutants/*pharmacokinetics/*poisoning;Insecticides/*pharmacokinetics/*poisoning;Confounding Factors;Epidemiologic,,

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to organochlorine (β coefficient, -0.022; 95% CI, -0.04 to -0.003) and PFAS (β coefficient, -0.017; 95% CI, -0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level.

Increasing epidemiological evidence suggest that EDCs may affect the development or progression of breast cancer and consequently lead to lifelong harmful health consequences, especially when exposure occurs during early life in humans. Yet so far no appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review all the available epidemiological studies about the association of the levels of environmental exposures of EDCs with breast cancer risk. METHODS: The search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved articles from PubMed (MEDLINE) until 10 March 2021. The key words used in this research were: ""Endocrine disruptor(s)"" OR ""Endocrine disrupting chemical(s)"" OR any of the EDCs mentioned below AND ""Breast cancer"" to locate all relevant articles published. We included only cohort studies and case-control studies. All relevant articles were accessed in full text and were evaluated and summarized in tables. RESULTS: We identified 131 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. EDCs reviewed herein included pesticides (e.g. p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), atrazine, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin)), synthetic chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), parabens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contraceptive pills), phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein, resveratrol), and certain mycotoxins (e.g. zearalenone). Most studies assessed environmental EDCs exposure via biomarker measurements. CONCLUSION: We identified certain EDC exposures could potentially elevate the risk of breast cancer. As majority of EDCs are highly persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative, it is essential to assess the long-term impacts of EDC exposures, especially multi-generational and transgenerational. Also, since food is often a major route of exposure to EDCs, well-designed exposure assessments of potential EDCs in food and food packing are necessary and their potential link to breast cancer development need to be carefully evaluated for subsequent EDC policy making and regulations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",,Breast Neoplasms,,

Instead, individual outcomes such as pericardial edema and yolk sac edema were more reliable indicators of developmental toxicity. In addition, we ranked the chemicals based on toxicity with the Toxicological Priority Index (ToxPi) program and via a teratogenic ratio, and found that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) had the highest ToxPi score, triphenyltin acetate had the highest average ToxPi score (corrected for missing data and having more than 4 outcomes), and N-methyl-dithiocarbamate had the highest teratogenic ratio. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",10.1016/j.reprotox.2013.06.070,Teratogens,,

Pesticides constitute a heterogeneous group of compounds designed specifically to control different pests. Besides measuring their levels or that of their metabolites in air, plasma, serum, blood, urine, etc., some studies reported increased DNA damage levels after occupational or environmental pesticides exposure, evidenced by several cytogenetic biomarkers such as chromosomal aberrations (CA), sister chromatid exchanges (SCE), micronuclei frequency (MN) together with other nuclear abnormalities (NA), alkaline comet assay, but also changes in oxidative stress parameters and miRNA levels. Single or combined, these techniques have also been used in genotoxic biomonitoring studies of workers occupationally exposed to pesticides in Mexico. Despite being a country with great agricultural activity and reported excessive pesticide use, genotoxic studies have been relatively few and, in some cases, contradictory.

A review of the documents related to the association of prenatal exposure of OCPs with fetal or neonatal thyroid function tests provides us with heterogeneous data in this field. Factors such as differences in the studied populations and their area, ethnic and genetic background, time and rate of exposure, possible interaction of other thyroid-disrupting environmental factors and dietary intake of micronutrients such as iodine and/or selenium are considered the main limitations for making an accurate conclusion.

Observational studies (cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort) in humans that investigated the association between PCBs exposure and the risk of endometriosis will be included. The outcome will be endometriosis risk in association with PCBs exposure. The primary screening and data extraction will be performed by three team members independently and will be judged by opinion with the fourth member. The modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) will be used for the quality assessment of studies.

Building on a previous review (Barrie et al., Arctic contaminants: sources, occurrence and pathways. Sci Total Environ 1992:1-74), we highlight new knowledge developed under the NCP on the sources, occurrence and pathways of contaminants (organochlorines, Hg, Pb and Cd, PAHs, artificial radionuclides). Starting from the global scale, we examine emission histories and sources for selected contaminants focussing especially on the organochlorines. Physical and chemical properties, transport processes in the environment (e.g. winds, currents, partitioning), and models are then used to identify, understand and illustrate the connection between the contaminant sources in industrial and agricultural regions to the south and the eventual arrival of contaminants in remote regions of the Arctic. Within the Arctic, we examine how contaminants impinge on marine and terrestrial pathways and how they are subsequently either removed to sinks or remain where they can enter the biosphere. As a way to focus this synthesis on key concerns of northern residents, a number of special topics are examined including: a mass balance for HCH and toxaphene (CHBs) in the Arctic Ocean; a comparison of PCB sources within Canada's Arctic (Dew Line Sites) with PCBs imported through long-range transport; an evaluation of concerns posed by three priority metals–Hg, Pb and Cd; an evaluation of the risks from artificial radionuclides in the ocean; a review of what is known about new-generation pesticides that are replacing the organochlorines; and a comparison of natural vs. anthropogenic sources of PAH in the Arctic. The research and syntheses provide compelling evidence for close connectivity between the global emission of contaminants from industrial and agricultural activities and the Arctic. For semi-volatile compounds that partition strongly into cold water (e.g. HCH) we have seen an inevitable loading of Arctic aquatic reservoirs. Drastic HCH emission reductions have been rapidly followed by reduced atmospheric burdens with the result that the major reservoir and transport agent has become the ocean. In the Arctic, it will take decades for the upper ocean to clear itself of HCH. For compounds that partition strongly onto particles, and for which the soil reservoir is most important (e.g. PCBs), we have seen a delay in their arrival in the Arctic and some fractionation toward more volatile compounds (e.g. lower-chlorinated PCBs). Despite banning the production of PCB in the 1970s, and despite decreases of PCBs in environmental compartments in temperate regions, the Arctic presently shows little evidence of reduced PCB loadings. We anticipate a delay in PCB reductions in the Arctic and environmental lifetimes measured in decades. Although artificial radionuclides have caused great concern due to their direct disposal on Russian Shelves, they are found to pose little threat to Canadian waters and, indeed, much of the radionuclide inventory can be explained as remnant global fallout, which was sharply curtailed in the 1960s, and waste emissions released under license by the European reprocessing plants. Although Cd poses a human dietary concern both for terrestrial and marine mammals, we find little evidence that Cd in marine systems has been impacted by human activities. There is evidence of contaminant Pb in the Arctic, but loadings appear presently to be decreasing due to source controls (e.g. removal of Pb from gasoline) in Europe and North America. Of the metals, Hg provokes the greatest concern; loadings appear to be increasing in the Arctic due to global human activities, but such loadings are not evenly distributed nor are the pathways by which they enter and move within the Arctic well understood.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",,Humans;Hydrocarbons;Animals;Ecosystem;Arctic Regions;Canada;Environmental Pollutants/*analysis/metabolism;*Environmental Pollution;Pesticides/analysis;Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons/analysis;Radioisotopes/analysis;Chlorinated/analysis,,

Random effects meta-analyses showed that phenoxy herbicides, carbamate insecticides, organophosphorus insecticides and the active ingredient lindane, an organochlorine insecticide, were positively associated with NHL. In a handful of papers, associations between pesticides and NHL subtypes were reported; B cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicides and the organophosphorus herbicide glyphosate.

Most studies reporting concentrations of organochlorines in pinnipeds have investigated ringed, grey, and harbour seals. Very few studies have been carried out on pinnipeds from the southern hemisphere. Pre-1980, the highest mean wet-weight blubber concentrations of DDT and related metabolites (911 +/- 582 micrograms g-1) were recorded in sea lions from California. The highest pre-1980 blubber concentrations of PCBs (1470 +/- 922 micrograms g-1) were recorded in harbour seals from the Netherlands. In later studies, the highest blubber concentrations of PCBs have been recorded from grey seals of the Dee estuary, UK [46.79 (10.17-116.68) micrograms g-1]. The highest DDT concentrations measured in individual pinnipeds appear to be in the 1-15 micrograms g-1 range, and such levels have been recorded from ringed, grey, and harbour seals and Australian fur seals. There are problems in identifying trends based on different studies. These include the improvement in analytical methods with time and the lack of uniformity in analytical methodology between laboratories as well as in the biological material analyzed. Insufficient standardized studies have been undertaken for a clear picture of temporal trends in DDT and PCB concentrations in pinniped tissues to be identified. Reported results show variations in contaminant concentrations between pinniped colonies from different sites, and special reference has been made to comparison of contaminant burdens between the UK colonies. Insufficient standardized information is currently available for patterns of contamination in pinnipeds to be assessed on a global scale. Many, although not all, studies have shown evidence for age and sex correlation for organochlorine concentrations in pinnipeds; male seals continuing to accumulate certain organochlorines throughout their lives; female seals accumulating these compounds until maturity when they lose part of their body burdens to their offspring via transplancental transfer and, more importantly, via lactation. The ability of pinnipeds to metabolize organochlorine compounds appears to be less well developed than in terrestrial mammals and seems to vary between seal species. Reported effects on pinnipeds, which have been suggested to result from organochlorine contamination, include skeletal deformities and impacts on reproduction, such as uterine blockages. The evidence of a relationship between recent epizootics in marine mammal populations and organochlorine pollution suggests that viruses and pollution are potential significant contributors to mortalities, but other factors, such as unseasonably warm temperatures and high seal densities, cannot be precluded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",,Male;Animals;Water Pollutants;Female;Species Specificity;Tissue Distribution;Reproduction/drug effects;Caniformia/*metabolism;Insecticides/analysis/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity;Chemical/analysis/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity,,

We aimed to study the strength and validity of the suggested environmental risk factors or biomarkers of autism spectrum disorder. Methods: We did an umbrella review and systematically appraised the relevant meta-analyses of observational studies. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for papers published between database inception and Oct 17, 2018, and screened the reference list of relevant articles. We obtained the summary effect, 95% CI, heterogeneity, and 95% prediction intervals. We examined small study effects and excess significance. We did analyses under credibility ceilings. This review is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018091704. Findings: 46 eligible articles yielded data on 67 environmental risk factors (544 212 cases, 81 708 787 individuals) and 52 biomarkers (15 614 cases, 15 433 controls). Evidence of association was convincing for maternal age of 35 years or over (relative risk [RR] 1·31, 95% CI 1·18–1·45), maternal chronic hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 1·48, 1·29–1·70), maternal gestational hypertension (OR 1·37, 1·21–1·54), maternal overweight before or during pregnancy (RR 1·28, 1·19–1·36), pre-eclampsia (RR 1·32, 1·20–1·45), prepregnancy maternal antidepressant use (RR 1·48, 1·29–1·71), and maternal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use during pregnancy (OR 1·84, 1·60–2·11). Only two associations, maternal overweight before or during pregnancy and SSRI use during pregnancy, retained their high level of evidence under subset sensitivity analyses. Evidence from biomarkers was scarce, being supported by p values close to the significance threshold and too few cases. Interpretation: Convincing evidence suggests that maternal factors, such as age and features of metabolic syndrome, are associated with risk of autism spectrum disorder. Although SSRI use during pregnancy was also associated with such risk when exposed and non-exposed groups were compared, this association could be affected by other confounding factors, considering that prepregnancy maternal antidepressant use was also convincingly associated with higher risk of autism spectrum disorder. Findings from previous studies suggest that one possible confounding factor is underlying maternal psychiatric disorders.

Some congeners of DDT and PCB elicit very weak to weak estrogenic responses in animals, while the dioxin TCDD and related compounds have antiestrogenic properties. This review summarizes the evidence regarding whether certain organochlorine compounds, usually as persistent food-chain contaminants, increase the risk of breast and endometrial cancers through their estrogenic potential, In humans, neither ecologic data nor occupational studies provide clear support for an association between organochlorine exposure and the occurrence of these cancers. In our summary analysis of occupational exposure, the rate ratio of breast cancer for exposed cf unexposed women was 0.84 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.50-1.33) for PCBs and 1.08 (CI = 0.68-1.58) for TCDD, Similarly, effect estimates close to unity were found in summary analysis of breast cancer case-control studies regarding levels of DDE and PCB in adipose tissue or serum. In two recent nested case-control studies using stored specimens, the odds ratio per standard deviation increase in serum p,p'-DDE was 1.27 (CI = 0.95-1.69). Although estrogenic effects of certain organochlorine compounds should be easier to detect on the endometrium, we know of no analytic epidemiologic studies of endometrial cancer published to date. We conclude that available data do not indicate that organochlorines will affect the risk of these two cancers in any but the most unusual situation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",10.1007/BF00054165,Estrogens,,

A systematic review of in vitro, in vivo and epidemiological studies.",2020,1,1,Environmental research,1096-0953 (Electronic),186,,109561,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32668538/,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are relevant families of persistent organic pollutants, which have been linked to several long-term adverse health effects. The mechanisms of action of these pollutants are still poorly understood. However, there are some evidences suggesting that inflammation might play a key role on their effects. AIM: To systematically synthesize the published in vitro, in vivo and epidemiological data assessing the potential influence of exposure to OCPs and PCBs on the development of an inflammatory milieu. METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed original research papers published until 1st May 2019 was conducted, by using Medline, Web of Science and Scopus databases. A total of 39 articles met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated in this review. RESULTS: The majority of the studies showed significant associations of PCB and OCP exposure with all inflammatory markers measured (n = 30). Some studies showed positive and negative associations (n = 7) and only two studies evidenced negative associations (n = 2). Most of the available evidences came from in vitro and in vivo studies (n = 31), with few epidemiological studies (n = 8). CONCLUSIONS: We found consistent positive associations between exposure to PCBs and OCPs and the development of a pro-inflammatory milieu, with only few discrepancies. However, given the limited epidemiological evidence found, our results warrant further research in order to elucidate the real contribution of these pollutants on the inflammatory processes and subsequent diseases.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",,Humans;Pesticides;Environmental Monitoring;Epidemiologic Studies;*Environmental Pollutants/toxicity;*Pesticides/analysis/toxicity;*Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis/toxicity;*Hydrocarbons;Chlorinated/analysis/toxicity,,

Objective (1) To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies on the association between residential/household/domestic exposure to pesticides and childhood brain tumors. (2) To clarify variables that could impact the results. Methods Publications in English were identified from a MEDLINE search through 28 February 2017 and from the reference list of identified publications. Risk estimates were extracted from 18 case-control studies published between 1979 and 2016 and study quality assessments were performed. Summary odds ratios (mOR) were calculated according to fixed and random-effect meta-analysis models. Separate analyses were conducted after stratification for study quality, critical exposure period, exposure location, specific exposures, pesticide category, application methods, type of pest treated, type of CBT, child's age at diagnosis and geographic location. Results Statistically significant associations were observed with CBT after combining all studies (mOR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.13–1.40) without evidence of inconsistency between study results or publication bias. Specifically, increased risks were observed for several groupings and more particularly for gliomas and exposure involving insecticides. Statistical significance was also reached for high quality studies, for all exposure periods, for indoor exposure and, more particularly, during the prenatal period for all stratifications involving insecticides (except for outdoor use), for pet treatments, for flea/tick treatment, for studies from USA/Canada and studies from Europe (borderline) as well as for data from studies including children of up to 10 years at diagnosis and of up to 15 years. Conclusions Our findings support an association between residential exposure to pesticides and childhood brain tumors. Although causality cannot be established, these results add to the evidence leading to recommend limiting residential use of pesticides and to support public health policies serving this objective. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: table 2 has each of the pesticide studies,figure 2 has each of the pesticide studies,does not distinguish pesticides into chemical classes",10.1016/j.envint.2017.05.018,Pesticides;Risk Factors;Brain;Brain Neoplasms,,

rayyan-894980626,Remediation of organic pollutants by Brassica species,2020,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,"The industrial revolution has put the soil environment under pollution, pouring a variety of toxic substances into it. These polluting substances include organic and inorganic compounds that pose health risks to human beings via food chain. At present, emphasis has been given to those organic pollutants that sometimes have persistence and reside in soil for a very long time. Major sources of organic pollutants are the agricultural inputs, industrial effluents, fossil fuel burning, and sewage wastes. Several classes of harmful organic pollutants include persistent organic pollutants (POPs), phenols, hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs). Ultimate sink of all these contaminants is water bodies and soil on which growing plants take up a significant portion of these contaminants, but their intratissue fate varies among species. Phytoremediation of the soils contaminated with these organic pollutants is an economical, environment friendly, and efficient technique. Brassica species being famous for their vigorous growth and hyperaccumulator nature have become a subject of extensive investigations regarding their role in accumulation and degradation of pollutants from soil and water bodies. Brassica species can maintain a good and healthy growth that makes tissue dilution of uptaken contaminants and degradation of these intracellular invasive species via modulating cellular physiology and enzymatic machinery. Brassica vigorous roots provide active sites for static adsorption of contaminants from soil and water bodies and release exudates that facilitate growth of contaminant-degrading rhizobacteria. Bacterial brassica partnership has an incremental impact on degradation of organic pollutants so does application of immobilizing organic and inorganic amendments. Once uptaken, these contaminants are converted into sulfur-containing compounds inside Brassica body that make dry tissue of Brassica species an excellent fuel leading their use for energy generation under biofumigation process. This chapter is an effort to give a comprehensive review on the fate of organic pollutants in the environment and the role of Brassica species in environmental cleansing via phytoremediation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: We compared data from \textgreater30 studies containing congener-specific elimination rates. Half-life data were extracted and compiled into a summary table. We then created a subset of these data based on defined exclusionary criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: We defined values for each congener that approximate the half-life in an infant and in an adult. A linear interpolation of these values was used to examine the relationship between half-life and age, percent body fat, and absolute body fat. We developed predictive equations based on these relationships and adjustments for individual characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The half-life of dioxins in the body can be predicted using a linear relationship with age adjusted for body fat, smoking, and breast-feeding. Data suggest an alternative method based on a linear relationship between half-life and total body fat, but this approach requires further testing and validation with individual measurements.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no organochlorine pesticide",10.1289/ehp.11781,Humans;Male;Female;Infant;Adult;Reference Values;Models;Smoke;Age Factors;Adipose Tissue;Biological;Smoking;Breast Feeding;pharmacokinetics;Half-Life;polychlorinated biphenyls;Body Composition;Dioxins/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics;elimination rate;Furans/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics;half-life;poly-chlorinated dibenzofurans;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics;polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins;Furans,,

A number of studies on the occurrence of POPs confirm their presence in various environmental compartments and human body. In order to deal with this global concern, India has recently prepared the National Implementation Plan (NIP) of the Stockholm Convention. Common beliefs point at India as a hot spot of POP contamination and human exposure; however no systematic analysis was ever performed so far considering all available past data on POP occurrence. This review aims to examine the distribution pattern of POPs in multicompartment environment and human samples, meta-analysis of time trends in exposure levels to environment and humans, and cross country comparison of POP contamination with China. Based on this review, it can be concluded that the Indian environment and human population are highly contaminated by DDTs and HCHs; however scarcity of data on other POPs makes it challenging to assess their nationwide human and environmental exposure. No evidence of a general decline in DDT and HCH residues in the environment and human body come out from the meta-analysis of time trend. While comparing contamination levels between India and China, tendency towards decline in POP contamination is visible in China, unlike India.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: they do calculate log concentration trends across time",,Humans;Animals;Environmental Monitoring;India;Humanism;Humanities;*Environmental Exposure;Aquatic Organisms/chemistry;Environmental Pollutants/*analysis/blood;Geologic Sediments/chemistry;Organic Chemicals/*analysis/blood;Water/chemistry,,

METHODS: Prospective cohort and case-control studies providing risk and precision estimates relating PD to exposure to pesticides or solvents or to proxies of exposure were considered eligible. The heterogeneity in risk estimates associated with objective study quality was also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 104 studies/3,087 citations fulfilled inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. In prospective studies, study quality was not a source of heterogeneity. PD was associated with farming and the association with pesticides was highly significant in the studies in which PD diagnosis was self-reported. In case-control studies, study quality appeared to be a source of heterogeneity in risk estimates for some exposures. Higher study quality was frequently associated with a reduction in heterogeneity. In high-quality case-control studies, PD risk was increased by exposure to any-type pesticides, herbicides, and solvents. Exposure to paraquat or maneb/mancozeb was associated with about a 2-fold increase in risk. In high-quality case-control studies including an appreciable number of cases (>200), heterogeneity remained significantly high (>40%) only for insecticides, organochlorines, organophosphates, and farming; also, the risk associated with rural living was found to be significant. CONCLUSIONS: The literature supports the hypothesis that exposure to pesticides or solvents is a risk factor for PD. Further prospective and high-quality case-control studies are required to substantiate a cause-effect relationship. The studies should also focus on specific chemical agents.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",,Humans;Pesticides;Cohort Studies;Case-Control Studies;Self Report;Prospective Studies;Parkinson Disease;Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects;Pesticides/*adverse effects;Herbicides/*adverse effects;Parkinson Disease/diagnosis/*etiology;Solvents/*adverse effects,,

We searched for information in official agency records and peer-reviewed scientific literature. Risk quotients were calculated to assess the potential risk posed to aquatic life by the individual pesticides based on their levels of water contamination. Studies about the occurrence of pesticides in freshwaters in Brazil are scarce and concentrated in few sampling sites in 5 of the 27 states. Herbicides (21) accounted for the majority of the substances investigated, followed by fungicides (11), insecticides (10) and plant growth regulators (1). Insecticides are the class of major concern.

Persistent chemical compounds, such as pesticides, tend to be lipophilic and are detected in human breast milk and adipose tissue. Therefore, the present systematic review aims to clarify the gender difference in breast cancer concerning pesticide exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 70 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. RESULTS: From the studies analyzed, it was observed that exposure to pesticides could be a risk factor for breast cancer in women, in particular in young women and in women who experienced menarche at a young age. In contrast, no association was found for breast cancer in men. Female breast cancer is correlated with estrogen receptor-negative tumor characteristics. Breast cancer in men was no correlated with pesticide exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer in women has been linked to estrogen receptor positivity, but this positivity appears to be inversely related to fertility. The estrogen-like effects of organochlorine pesticides could be the cause of the observed gender differences.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",,Humans;Hydrocarbons;Male;Pesticides;Female;Risk Factors;Breast Neoplasms;Sex Characteristics;Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects;Pesticides/*adverse effects;Breast Neoplasms/*chemically induced;Chlorinated/*adverse effects,,

These studies focused on Organophosphates (OP), Organochlorine (OC), Pyrethroid (PT), Neonicotinoid (NN), Carbamate (CM), and mixed exposures. Preclinical studies, where the OP Chlorpyrifos (CPF) compound is the one most studied, pointed to an association between gestational exposure and increased ASD-like behaviors, although the data are inconclusive with regard to other ages or pesticides. Studies in humans focused on prenatal exposure to OP and OC agents, and report cognitive and behavioral alterations related to ASD symptomatology. The results of both suggest that gestational exposure to certain OP agents could be linked to the clinical signs of ASD.

Research studies dating over the last half-century consistently demonstrate a decline in male fertility that is incompletely explained by obesity, known genetic causes, or diet and lifestyle changes alone. Human exposures have changed dramatically over the same time course as this fertility decline. Synthetic chemicals surround us. Some are benevolent; however, many are known to cause disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and impair spermatogenesis. More than 80,000 chemicals are registered with the United States National Toxicology Program and nearly 2,000 new chemicals are introduced each year. Many of these are known toxins, such as phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aromatic amines, and organophosphate esters, and have been banned or significantly restricted by other countries as they carry known carcinogenic effects and are reproductively toxic. In the United States, many of these chemicals are still permissible in exposure levels known to cause reproductive harm. This contrasts to other chemical regulatory legislature, such as the European Union's REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) regulations which are more comprehensive and restrictive. Quantification of these diverse exposures on an individual level has proven challenging, although forthcoming technologies may soon make this data available to consumers. Establishing causality and the proportion of idiopathic infertility attributable to environmental toxin exposures remains elusive, however, continued investigation, avoidance of exposure, and mitigation of risk is essential to our reproductive health. The aim of this review is to examine the literature linking changes in male fertility to some of the most common environmental exposures. Specifically, pesticides and herbicides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dibromochloropropane (DBCP), organophosphates and atrazine, endocrine disrupting compounds including plastic compounds phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), heavy metals, natural gas/oil, non-ionizing radiation, air and noise pollution, lifestyle factors including diet, obesity, caffeine use, smoking, alcohol and drug use, as well as commonly prescribed medications will be discussed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",,Fertility;Fertilizers;Self-Fertilization,,

Changes in these end-points resulting from chemical exposure can cause alterations in micro-evolutionary forces (mutation, drift, selection and gene flow) that control the genetic composition of populations. With multi-generation exposures, anthropogenic contamination can lead to a population with an altered genetic composition, which may respond differently to future stressors. These evolutionary changes are rarely discussed in regulatory or risk assessment frameworks, but the growing body of literature that documents their existence suggests that these important population-level impacts should be considered. In this meta-analysis we have compared existing contamination levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that have been documented to be associated with evolutionary changes in resident aquatic organisms to regulatory benchmarks for these contaminants. The original intent of this project was to perform a meta-analysis on evolutionary events associated with PCB and PAH contamination. However, this effort was hindered by a lack of consistency in congener selection for ""total"" PCB or PAH measurements. We expanded this manuscript to include a discussion of methods used to determine PCB and PAH total contamination in addition to comparing regulatory guidelines and contamination that has caused evolutionary effects. Micro-evolutionary responses often lead populations onto unique and unpredictable trajectories. Therefore, to better understand the risk of population-wide alterations occurring, we need to improve comparisons of chemical contamination between affected locations. In this manuscript we offer several possibilities to unify chemical comparisons for PCBs and PAHs that would improve comparability among evolutionary toxicology investigations, and with regulatory guidelines. In addition, we identify studies documenting evolutionary change in the presence of PCB and PAH contamination levels below applicable regulatory benchmarks.","<p>Place: United States</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not organochlorine pesticide | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no organochlorine pesticide",10.1007/s10646-016-1735-6,Environmental Monitoring;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Polychlorinated biphenyls;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons;Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons;*Environmental Pollutants;*Ecotoxicology;Evolutionary toxicology;Micro-evolution,,

Many contaminants alter behaviour at concentrations commonly experienced in the environment, with negative consequences for individual fitness, populations and communities. A comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of the behavioural sensitivity of amphibians is warranted to better understand the population-level and resultant ecological impacts of contaminants. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating behavioural changes following exposure to contaminants. Most studies were conducted in North America and Europe on larval stages, and 64% of the 116 studies focussed on the effects of insecticides. We found that a suite of contaminants influence a wide range of behaviours in amphibians, with insecticides typically invoking the strongest responses. In particular, insecticides increased rates of abnormal swimming, and reduced escape responses to simulated predator attacks. Our analysis identified five key needs for future research, in particular the need: (1) for researchers to provide more details of experimental protocols and results (2) to develop a strong research base for future quantitative reviews, (3) to broaden the suite of contaminants tested, (4) to better study and thus understand the effects of multiple stressors, and (5) to establish the ecological importance of behavioural alterations. Behavioural endpoints provide useful sub-lethal indicators of how contaminants influence amphibians, and coupled with standard ecotoxicological endpoints, can provide valuable information for population models assessing the broader ecological consequences of environmental contamination.

Our study underlines a relationship between ED exposure and FT3, FT4 and TSH alteration, especially for polychlorinated biphenyl, polybromophenyl ether, perchlorate, dioxins/dioxin and bisphenol A. However no study shows a significant relationship with any pathological and clinical expression of thyroid disease, mainly due to several confounding variables in the observational studies, both environmental and genetic. Major risk conditions are represented by pregnancy status and breast feeding due to the importance of the thyroid hormones in fetal neurodevelopment. Despite most studies declaring they needed further research about this topic to settle the relationship between ED and thyroid disease, most authors were worried about the potential health effects on several endocrine targets and in frail conditions. They recommended a precautionary and integrated approach based on primary prevention activities, through screening and health education campaigns, and the reduction or elimination of these substances as suggested by internationalconferences. This opens the possibility for innovative collaboration between medical research, hygiene prevention and international legislation in the hope to set up a new dimension in the approach to many diseases.","<p>5th European Conference on Public Health, St Julians, MALTA, NOV 08-10, 2012</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: full text not available | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no full text",,Thyroid Gland,,

However, the analysis of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is essential to target meaningful endpoints of cardiotoxicity and allow a close-to-real life understanding of the role of chronic and acute exposure to multiple toxicants. The aim of this study is to outline the process for a systematic review of the literature that investigates the relationship between environmental pollution and left ventricular dysfunction. This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-P) statement. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases will be searched without applying search filters. Two independent reviewers will screen all titles and abstracts and identify the articles to be included in the synthesis. The risk of bias (RoB) will be assessed using an instrument developed for non-randomized (i.e., observational) studies (NRS) of environmental exposures. The results of cohort, case-control, cross-sectional, time-series, and case-crossover studies will be extracted and presented in tables considering different population subgroups and length of exposure. This protocol will be expected to provide a sound basis for selecting toxic chemicals and pollutants to contribute with the epidemiological evidence to the in vitro testing protocol within the EU-funded ALTERNATIVE Project. © 2022 by the authors.

Monogenic mutations in over 30 genes are associated with about 10% of ALS cases. The age at onset of ALS and disease types has been found to influence ALS progression. The present study was designed to identify additional putative risk factors associated with the onset and progression of ALS using systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. Risk factors that may be associated with ALS include: 1) genetic mutations, including the intermediate CAG repeat expansion in ATXN2; 2) previous exposure to heavy metals such as lead and mercury; 3) previous exposure to organic chemicals, such as pesticides and solvents; 4) history of electric shock; 5) history of physical trauma/injury (including head trauma/injury); 6) smoking (a weak risk factor for ALS in women); and 6) other risk factors, such as participating in professional sports, lower body mass index, lower educational attainment, or occupations requiring repetitive/strenuous work, military service, exposure to Beta-N-methylamino-L-alanin and viral infections. Risk factors that may be associated with ALS progression rate include: 1) nutritional status, including vitamin D deficiency; 2) comorbidities; 3) ethnicity and genetic factors; 4) lack of supportive care; and 4) smoking. The extent to which these associations may be causal is discussed, with further research recommended to strengthen the evidence on which determinations of causality may be based. © 2016","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: figure 2 has each of the pesticide studies,does not distinguish pesticides into chemical classes | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no organochlorine pesticide",10.1016/j.neuro.2016.06.015,Risk Factors;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;Motor Neuron Disease,,

To understand pesticide effects on fish ChEs mean activity and variability, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses. Our goal was to verify (i) if brain and muscle ChEs responded differently to pesticide exposure; (ii) how fish size and life stage (i.e., juvenile and adult) influence ChEs variability and mean activity; (iii) what type of pesticides (i.e., herbicide, insecticide, and fungicide) has the strongest effect, and if the analytical-grade compounds differ from commercial formulations; (iv) if increasing concentrations combined with prolonged exposure leads to stronger ChEs inhibition; and (v) how each class of pesticide affects these enzymes. We validated ChEs reliability as biomarkers and identified factors influencing their response. Regardless of tissue, BChE response was more variable than AChE, and no difference between their average activity was detected. The size of juvenile fish is an important factor affecting ChEs mean activity and variability, whereas pesticide had no significant effect on adult fish ChEs. Insecticides were stronger inhibitors compared to herbicides and fungicides. Analytical-grade compounds decreased ChEs mean activity to a higher degree than commercial formulations. The combined effect of concentration and time was only significant for fungicides and insecticides. Among classes, organophosphorus insecticides had the strongest effect on ChEs, followed by carbamates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids. Organophosphorus herbicides and oxazolidinones were the only herbicides to decrease ChEs mean activity significantly, and their effects were similar from those of pyrethroids and organochlorines. Additionally, our results identified research gaps, such as the small number of studies on fungicides, neonicotinoids and other relevant pesticides. These findings suggest future directions, which might help researchers identify robust cause-effect relationships between fish ChEs and pesticides.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",,Pesticides;Animals;Reproducibility of Results;Acetylcholinesterase;Cholinesterase Inhibitors;Butyrylcholinesterase;*Insecticides;*Pesticides/toxicity,,

The aim of the present study was to systematically review and evaluate the human evidence on the associations between internal levels of POPs and in vitro Fertilization (IVF) outcomes among women. We applied a protocol based on the National Toxicology Program Office of Health Assessment and Translation's guidelines for the study search, selection and quality assessment. Fifteen studies were finally retained in the present work. The results showed that main families of POPs are still pervasive in follicular fluid and serum of women undergoing IVF treatments. Globally, we found inconsistent findings across studies for specific exposure-outcome dyads, suggesting that adverse effects of POPs on IVF outcomes cannot be ruled out. Specifically, there is evidence that POPs, notably some polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides, may impair embryo quality and pregnancy rates. Most studies have been performed in small cohorts (n<50) and focused on PCBs and OCPs, whereas major research gaps remain for emerging compounds (e.g. perfluoroalkylated substances) and the most clinically relevant outcome, live birth rate. The overall evidence presented 'serious' or 'very serious' risk of bias, mainly due to the lack of consideration of relevant confounding variables, low sample size or underreporting of methods.

OBJECTIVE: In this meta-analysis, we aimed to examine associations between residential childhood pesticide exposures and childhood cancers. DATA SOURCES: We searched all observational studies published in PubMed before February 2014 and reviewed reference sections of articles derived from searches. STUDY SELECTION: The literature search yielded 277 studies that met inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Sixteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. We calculated effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by using a random effect model with inverse variance weights. RESULTS: We found that childhood exposure to indoor but not outdoor residential insecticides was associated with a significant increase in risk of childhood leukemia (odds ratio [OR] = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.26-1.72; I2 = 30%) and childhood lymphomas (OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.15-1.78; I2 = 0%). A significant increase in risk of leukemia was also associated with herbicide exposure (OR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.10-1.44; I2 = 0%). Also observed was a positive but not statistically significant association between childhood home pesticide or herbicide exposure and childhood brain tumors. LIMITATIONS: The small number of studies included in the analysis represents a major limitation of the current analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this meta-analysis indicated that children exposed to indoor insecticides would have a higher risk of childhood hematopoietic cancers. Additional research is needed to confirm the association between residential indoor pesticide exposures and childhood cancers. Meanwhile, preventive measures should be considered to reduce children's exposure to pesticides at home.

We aimed to summarise the environmental risk factors that have been studied in relation to onset of multiple sclerosis, assess whether there is evidence for diverse biases in this literature, and identify risk factors without evidence of biases. Methods: We searched PubMed from inception to Nov 22, 2014, to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations between environmental factors and multiple sclerosis. For each meta-analysis we estimated the summary effect size by use of random-effects and fixed-effects models, the 95% CI, and the 95% prediction interval. We estimated the between-study heterogeneity expressed by I2 (defined as large for I2≥50%), evidence of small-study effects (ie, large studies had significantly more conservative results than smaller studies), and evidence of excess significance bias (ie, more studies than expected with significant results). Findings: Overall, 44 unique meta-analyses including 416 primary studies of different risk factors and multiple sclerosis were examined, covering a wide range of risk factors: vaccinations, comorbid diseases, surgeries, traumatic events and accidents, exposure to environmental agents, and biochemical, infectious, and musculoskeletal biomarkers. 23 of 44 meta-analyses had results that were significant at p values less than ·05 and 11 at p values less than ·001 under the random-effects model. Only three of the 11 significant meta-analyses (p&lt;·001) included more than 1000 cases, had 95% prediction intervals excluding the null value, and were not suggestive of large heterogeneity (I2&lt;50%), small-study effects (p for Egger's test &gt;·10), or excess significance (p&gt;·05). These were IgG seropositivity to Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) (random effects odds ratio [OR] 4·46, 95% CI 3·26-6·09; p for effect size=1·5 × 10-19; I2=43%), infectious mononucleosis (2·17, 1·97-2·39; p=3·1 × 10-50; I2=0%), and smoking (1·52, 1·39-1·66; p=1·7 × 10-18; I2=0%). Interpretation: Many studies on environmental factors associated with multiple sclerosis have caveats casting doubts on their validity. Data from more and better-designed studies are needed to establish robust evidence. A biomarker of Epstein-Barr virus (anti-EBNA IgG seropositivity), infectious mononucleosis, and smoking showed the strongest consistent evidence of an association.

Results: Both positive and negative associations are observed between early life exposure and weight or height at various ages, including as early as 14. months, as well as until 20. years of age. In none of the included studies negative associations between perinatal exposure to EDCs and body mass index (BMI) were found and in several studies a positive association was observed. Dose-response relations appear to be non-monotonic.

The findings were subjected to evidence grading according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) classification. We found > 40 cross-sectional and seven prospective studies regarding EDCs and risk of diabetes. Taken together, there is moderate evidence for a relationship between exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), a metabolite of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, and diabetes development. Regarding polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), it is likely that the rodent models used are not appropriate, and therefore the evidence is poorer than for p,p'-DDE. For other EDCs, such as bisphenol A, phthalates and perfluorinated chemicals, the evidence is scarce, since very few prospective studies exist. Brominated flame retardants do not seem to be associated with a disturbed glucose tolerance. Thus, evidence is accumulating that EDCs might be involved in diabetes development. Best evidence exists for p,p'-DDE.

Our aim was to explore exposure-response relationship between PCB-153 and p-p'-DDE and birth outcomes; to evaluate whether any no exposure-effect level and susceptible subgroups exist; and to assess the role of maternal gestational weight gain (GWG). We used a pooled dataset of 9377 mother-child pairs enrolled in 14 study populations from 11 European birth cohorts. General additive models were used to evaluate the shape of the relationships between organochlorine compounds and birth outcomes. We observed an inverse linear exposure-response relationship between prenatal exposure to PCB-153 and birth weight [decline of 194 g (95% CI -314, -74) per 1 mu g/L increase in PCB-153]. We showed effects on birth weight over the entire exposure range, including at low levels. This reduction seems to be stronger among children of mothers who were non-Caucasian or had smoked during pregnancy. The most susceptible subgroup was girls whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. After adjusting for absolute GWG or estimated fat mass, a reduction in birth weight was still observed. This study suggests that the association between low-level exposure to PCB-153 and birth weight exists and follows an inverse linear exposure-response relationship with effects even at low levels, and that maternal smoking and ethnicity modify this association.

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to quantitatively estimate the geographical distribution of DDE blood levels and record time-trends for specific countries and continents, exploiting available data from the scientific literature. Methods: A literature search was performed in SCOPUS and PUBMED databases. Studies were screened at 2 levels applying different sets of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Blood levels of DDE along with other variables of interest were extracted, and a meta-analysis of random effects was conducted, by using the package metafor within the statistical programming language R. Results were expressed as pooled geometric means (GM[95% confidence intervals, CIs]). Results: A total of 418 papers were included in the quantitative synthesis that contained data for 854 population subgroups, and analyzed a total of 195,595 samples. Overall global DDE concentrations dropped from 5207 (95% CI: 3616-7499) ng/g lipids during 1951-1969 to 207 (95% CI: 159-269) ng/g lipids for studies reporting sampling after 2000. Analyses for studies published from 2001 and onward revealed geographical differences regarding DDE burden. Discussion: The significant decline in DDE blood levels after its restriction is demonstrated in our results. Differences in decrease trends were observed in different parts of the globe, which can be explained by deferred implementation of environmental policies. In some countries DDE concentrations remain high, and systematic biomonitoring is proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Studies reporting occupational and accidental exposures were excluded. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate summary relative risks (SRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity across studies was assessed by I2 statistics, and publication bias both graphically and using Egger's and Begg's tests. Quality of included studies was assessed using the National Toxicology Program/Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP/OHAT). Confidence in the body of evidence and related level of evidence were assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) based on the NTP/OHAT framework. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020178079). RESULTS: The initial search led to 2,132 articles. Eight prospective cohort studies met our inclusion criteria, leading to 72,852 participants including 17,805 deaths. Overall exposure to PCBs was not statistically significantly associated with all-cause mortality (SRR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.90-1.41, n = 7 studies, low certainty); however, dietary exposure to PCBs was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular-specific mortality (SRR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.14-1.66, n = 3 studies, moderate certainty), while no association was found with cancer-specific mortality (SRR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.72-1.59, n = 5 studies, low certainty). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that background exposure to PCBs is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular-specific mortality in the general population with a ""moderate"" level of evidence. These findings should be interpreted with caution given the small number of studies on mortality in the general population.","<p>Place: Netherlands</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not organochlorine pesticide | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no organochlorine pesticide",10.1016/j.envint.2021.106663,Humans;Cohort Studies;Case-Control Studies;Prospective Studies;*Cardiovascular diseases;*PCBs;*Polychlorinated biphenyls;*Neoplasms;*Polychlorinated Biphenyls/toxicity;*Cancer;*Cohort studies;*Mortality,,

Methods: Following a systematic literature search, relative risk (RR) estimates for prostate cancer were extracted from 18 studies published between 1984 and 2004. All studies were summarised and evaluated for homogeneity and publication bias. As no significant heterogeneity was detected, combined RR estimators were calculated using a fixed effect model. Meta-analyses were performed both on the whole set of data and for each chemical class separately. Results: The meta-rate ratio estimate for all studies was 1.28 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.58]. After stratification by specific chemical class, consistent increases in the risk of prostate cancer were found in all groups but statistical significance was found only for accidental or non-accidental exposure to phenoxy herbicides contaminated with dioxins and furans. There was no obvious indication of publication bias. Conclusion: The overall meta-analysis provides additional quantitative evidence consistent with prior reviews focusing on other groups exposed to pesticides (farmers, pesticide applicators). The results again point to occupational exposure to pesticides as a possible risk factor for prostate cancer but the question of causality remains unanswered. Epidemiological evidence did not allow identifying a specific pesticide or chemical class that would be responsible for the increased risk but the strongest evidence comes from workers exposed to phenoxy herbicides possibly in relation with dioxin and/or furan contamination. © Springer 2006.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s10552-005-0443-y,Pesticides;Prostatic Neoplasms;Prostate,,

The objective of this systematic review is to determine a possible association between PCB exposure and the circulating thyroid hormones and thyrotropin (TSH) levels in adults, by analyzing the quality of published studies. A systematic review of epidemiological papers was conducted using PubMed. An evaluation of the quality of 22 studies was performed, and the papers were classified into two tiers: Tier I for studies with higher quality scores (eight) and Tier II for studies with lower quality scores (14). It appears that PCBs can interfere with thyroid hormone homeostasis: however epidemiological evidence is not entirely clear. For triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), Tier I studies showed either an inverse (four cases for T3; five cases for T4) or no significant association (two cases for T3; five cases for T4) with PCBs. In the case of free thyroxine and TSH, the Tier I papers observed no clear association with PCB levels. Rigorous study design, assessment of potential confounding factors, and fuller reporting of methods and results in future studies will facilitate understanding of whether PCB exposure is associated with changes in thyroid function.

Environmental toxicants are synthetic (i.e. manufactured) or naturally found chemicals that are not produced by organisms as a result of cellular metabolism (e.g. tobacco smoke, pesticides, etc.). There is limited consideration for how exposure to environmental toxicants can create adverse psychological health effects, specifically postpartum depression. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine if the literature supports a link between exposure to environmental toxicants during the prenatal/perinatal period and postpartum depression and if so, to identify whether there are specific classes of toxicants that provide a higher risk for postpartum depression. Several databases were used to search the online literature, with the following inclusion criteria: articles published in English, publication years between 1995-2018, and with women of reproductive age (15-49 years old). The article selection process comprised of screening each article by title/abstract, followed by screening those articles based on full-text. Six categories of toxicants were identified among the thirty included articles. Active/passive smoke exposure was largely found to increase the risk of developing postpartum depression; dietary supplements provided mixed results; antidepressants demonstrated preventative effects; particulate air pollution was found to be associated with postpartum depression; oral contraceptives (DMPA) exhibited an increase in postpartum depressive symptoms; and organochlorine pesticides had no associative risk. Quality assessments were performed for all of the included articles, with the majority being assessed as satisfactory. This systematic review presents as a foundation for encouraging future research to investigate the link between environment and mental health, in order to attain a greater perspective.</p> | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no full text",,Risk Factors;Perinatal,,

Authors have extracted data from different departments, published literature in research journals and National reports. Although the wide-spread usage of pesticides in Pakistan has controlled the pests, but like other countries, it has started causing environmental problems in the area. In some areas of Punjab and Sindh groundwater has been found contaminated and is constantly being under the process of contamination due to pesticide use. There is considerable evidence that farmers have overused and misused pesticides especially in cotton-growing areas. It is evident from the biological monitoring studies that farmers are at higher risk for acute and chronic health effects associated with pesticides due to occupational exposure. Furthermore, the intensive use of pesticides (higher sprays more than the recommended dose) in cotton areas involves a special risk for the field workers, pickers, and of an unacceptable residue concentration in cottonseed oil and cakes. The authors have also discussed the merits and demerits of different studies. The review will set the future course of action of different studies on pesticide exposure in Pakistan. Data limitations are still the major obstacle towards establishing clear environmental trends in Pakistan. The authors suggest that a reliable monitoring, assessment and reporting procedures shall be implemented in accordance with appropriate environmental policies, laws and regulations in order to minimize the pesticides exposure.

This study then reviews the impacts of irrigation water on vegetables in peri-and urban areas and the associated public health implications, and emerging contaminats in irrigation water in Ghana. Considering the quality of irrigation water, loads of enteric bacteria have been reported reaching 538 mpn/ml and 940 mpn/ml. Though total and fecal coliforms and E. coli have been detected in irrigable water in Ghana, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura were observed in vegetables. Lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, alpha-endosulfan, endrin, 1,1-dichloro-2, 2bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p-DDE), and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) are the dominant pesticides detected in water used for irrigation. The presence of Cr, Cd, Co, Cu, Zn, Pb, Fe, Ni, and Mn have been reported in irrigatable water. Contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) that require extensive research in irrigation water are antibiotics, viruses (norovirus and adenovirus), and estrogens. Since untreated wastewater is predominantly used for irrigation in some parts of Ghana, high levels of Hg and Cd have been detected.

It has been shown that these molecules are exceptionally stable in the environment, are carcinogenic and neurotoxic, and can cause dermal and ocular complications. Consequently, exposure to PCBs, even at trace levels, can have severe adverse effects on human health and the entire ecosystems. On the other hand, the conventional methods used for the extraction and quantification of PCBs face challenges that have limited their application. Some of such limitations include high consumption of organic solvents, complex multiple-step processes, and low sensitivity. To address these shortcomings, microextraction techniques have been developed as more efficient and greener procedures for the trace analysis of PCBs from different matrices. This research aims at conducting a comprehensive review of the microextraction techniques and analytical methods used for sample preparation and analysis of PCBs in different matrices, along with discussions about the challenges and future prospects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",10.1016/j.microc.2022.107442,character(0),,

POPs are associated with endocrine-disrupting effects including adverse reproductive outcomes that could affect fecundability, i.e. the capacity to conceive a pregnancy, quantified as time to pregnancy (TTP). OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Results of epidemiologic studies that examine the impact of various chemical classes of POPs on TTP have not been synthesised. We undertook a systematic review to summarise the strength of evidence for associations of four common groups of POPs with couple fecundability and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature in order to inform policy decisions and future research. SEARCH METHODS: We performed an electronic search of literature published between 1 January 2007 and 6 August 2019 in MEDLINE, EMBASE.com, Global Health, DART/TOXLINE and POPLINE. We included empirical research papers that examined human exposure to organochlorine (OC) pesticides, brominated flame retardants, polychlorinated organic compounds and/or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and considered TTP or fecundability as an outcome. Standardised forms for screening, data extraction and study quality were developed using DistillerSR software, and all reviews were completed in duplicate. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias and devised additional quality metrics based on specific methodological features of fecundability studies. OUTCOMES: The search returned 4573 articles, and 28 papers from 19 different studies met inclusion criteria. Among them, four studies measured TTP prospectively, three had data on participants' prenatal exposure, three examined associations in both male and female partners and one focused exclusively on males. Analyses varied widely in terms of exposure characterisation, precluding a meta-analytic approach. Evidence was strongest for adverse associations of female exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls with TTP, with some additional support for associations of female exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers and PFAS with longer TTP. Our review provided little or no support for associations between female exposure to OC pesticides or male exposure to any of the POP groups and TTP. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Evidence suggests that female exposure to at least some POPs may reduce fecundability. Although many of these chemicals are no longer in production, they are still detectable in human biosamples because of their persistence in the environment. Replacement chemicals that are being introduced as older ones are restricted may have similar reproductive consequences. Future studies should examine these newer POPs, assess interactions between POPs and other chemical and non-chemical exposures, investigate how POPs are distributed in and metabolised by the human body and focus on populations that may be disproportionately exposed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",,Humans;Male;Female;Pregnancy;Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers;Persistent Organic Pollutants;Fertility;Time-to-Pregnancy;*Pesticides/toxicity;*Environmental Pollutants/toxicity;*Polychlorinated Biphenyls/toxicity,,

This article is a review of DDT and DDE levels in human tissues from different countries in the world. Data on p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE levels in human adipose tissue, breast milk and serum were selected from more recent literature. It was discovered that countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America with more recent exposure to DDT and DDE have higher levels in human tissue than in Europe and the United States. The global concern for DDT and DDE is the environmental spread and persistence in the food chain. Hypothetically, there is a potential risk of harmful effects of DDT and DDE to human health. UNEP has cautiously taken action to protect human health, the environment and the earth from further destruction by persistent organic pollutants.

Some Clues to Heterogeneity in Study Results,2012,1,1,ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES,0091-6765,120,3,340-347,,,,,,"BACKGROUND: Previous systematic reviews have indicated that pesticide exposure is possibly associated with Parkinson disease (PD). However, considerable heterogeneity has been observed in study results. OBJECTIVE: We aimed at providing an update of the literature published on PD and exposure to pesticides by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. In addition, we investigated whether methodological differences between studies could explain the heterogeneity in study results. METHODS: We identified studies through a systematic literature search. We calculated summary risk ratios (sRRs) for pesticide exposure and subcategories using random effects meta-analyses and investigated sources of heterogeneity by meta-regression and stratified analyses. RESULTS: Thirty-nine case control studies, four cohort studies, and three cross-sectional studies were identified. An sRR of 1.62 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.40, 1.88] for pesticide exposure (ever vs. never) was found. Summary estimates for subclasses of pesticides indicated a positive association with herbicides and insecticides, but not with fungicides. Heterogeneity in individual study results was not related to study design, source of control population, adjustment of results for potential confounders, or geographical area. However, results were suggestive for heterogeneity related to differences in the exposure assessment. Job title based exposure assignment resulted in a higher sRR (2.5; 95% CI: 1.5, 4.1) than did assignment based on self-reported exposure (e.g., for self-reported ever/never exposure, sRR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 1.8). CONCLUSIONS: This review affirms the evidence that exposure to herbicides and insecticides increase the risk of PD. Future studies should focus on more objective and improved methods of pesticide exposure assessment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: figure 1 has each of the pesticide studies,does not distinguish pesticides into chemical classes,shows pesticides as occupational and non-occupational",10.1289/ehp.1103881,Pesticides;Parkinson Disease,,

This review discusses the current knowledge on India's distribution, occurrence, and tendencies of OCPs in multi-ecological conditions (air, water, soil, and sediments) and biota (plants and animals). Moreover, the available analytical technique for measuring OCP in India was reviewed and detailed. Twenty years (2001-2020) published data/work on residual OCP contamination in different environmental matrices were reviewed and critically analyzed. The reviewed literature revealed that the contamination level of OCPs in the Indian environment is the highest globally. DDT, HCH, and endosulfan were the most investigated OCP compounds (notably air and water) in the Indian environment. Although the residual OCP has been documented well in soil, water, and sediments matrice, very little work is available concerning air matrix, indicating prioritization of future research on residual OCP in air. In the absence of advanced and modernized measurement techniques in India, the usage of more sensitive and accurate methods such as gas chromatography combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry (MALD-TOF MS) or GC-TOF are warranted to capture the presence of secondary and tertiary metabolites of OCPs in environmental samples which are specific toxicant to human tissues and organs. There is a need for mass awareness and training to the farmer and other stakeholders about the fate of OCP pesticides in the environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",10.1016/j.microc.2022.107306,Pesticides;India,,

Humans are continuously exposed to POPs through diet, air particles, and household and commercial products; POPs are consistently detected in human tissues, including the pancreas. Epidemiological studies show a modest but consistent correlation between exposure to POPs and increased diabetes risk. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of epidemiological evidence and an in-depth evaluation of the in vivo and in vitro evidence that POPs cause beta-cell toxicity. We review evidence for six classes of POPs: dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), organophosphate pesticides (OPPs), flame retardants, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The available data provide convincing evidence implicating POPs as a contributing factor driving impaired glucose homeostasis, beta-cell dysfunction, and altered metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in islets. These findings support epidemiological data showing that POPs increase diabetes risk and emphasize the need to consider the endocrine pancreas in toxicity assessments. Our review also highlights significant gaps in the literature assessing islet-specific endpoints after both in vivo and in vitro POP exposure. In addition, most rodent studies do not consider the impact of biological sex or secondary metabolic stressors in mediating the effects of POPs on glucose homeostasis and beta-cell function. We discuss key gaps and limitations that should be assessed in future studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",10.1152/ajpendo.00358.2021,Persistent Organic Pollutants;Glucose;*Environmental Pollutants/toxicity;*Pesticides/analysis/toxicity;*Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis/toxicity;*Hydrocarbons;Chlorinated/analysis/toxicity,,

Pesticides also have diverse mechanisms of action that make it difficult to identify impacts on exposed wildlife. Behavioral measures represent an important link between physiological and ecological processes, and are often used to generalize sub-lethal effects of pesticide exposure. In order to bridge the toxicological and behavioral literature, and identify chemical classes that denote the largest threat, we conducted a meta-analysis summarizing the effects of pesticides on swim speed and activity of aquatic vertebrates. We found that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides reduced the swim speed of exposed amphibians and fish by 35%, and reduced overall activity by 72%. There were also differences in the magnitude of this effect across chemical classes, which likely reflect underlying physiological processes. Pyrethroids, carbamates, and organophosphates all produced a large decrease in swim speed, where as phosphonoglycines and triazines showed no overall effect. Pyrethroids, carbamates, organophosphates, organochlorines, and organotins also produced a large decrease in activity, while phosphonoglycines had no overall effect, and triazines had the opposite effect of increasing activity. Our results indicate that even sub-lethal concentrations of pesticides have a strong effect on critical behaviors of aquatic vertebrates, which can affect fitness and alter species interactions. We expect our synthesis can be used to identify chemical classes producing the largest sub-lethal effects for further research and management.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",,Pesticides;Animals;Water Pollutants;Time Factors;*Swimming;Amphibians/*physiology;Fishes/*physiology;Pesticides/classification/*toxicity;Chemical/classification/*toxicity,,

Other reasons of high pesticide residues present in Nigeria environment is due to inappropriate dosage applied of pesticides that leaves behind excess. However, its residues are found above safety levels in the air, water, and soil across the nation.

While it affects positively human nutrient and energy uptake, the presence of pesticide residues could, however, counterbalance these benefits and negatively affect human health. This systematic review provides an overview of studies on pesticide residues during the last decade and the related human health risk assessment. Thirty-five original articles published since 2010 reporting the levels of pesticide residues in raw cow's milk in 69 regions from 15 countries were reviewed. Data showed that pesticide residue levels were ranked as, DDTs> permethrin> bifenthrin> Drins> endrin> endosulfan> HCHs> cyhalothrin> cypermethrin> heptachlor> ethion> coumaphos> deltamethrin> dimethoate, chlorpyriphos> profenofos> malathion> dichlorvos> parathion methyl> carbaryl> aldicarb> carbofuran> methamidophos. High geographic variation was observed, and many regions appear as contaminated zones with high risks such as Punjab in Pakistan (× 3080 > MRL and × 113 > MRL for Cypermethrin and Drins, respectively), Sand Pedro in Columbia (× 1090 > MRL and × 200 > MRL for endrin and Drins, respectively), and Gezira State in Sudan (× 109 > MRL DDTs).

A good understanding of the causes can help attenuate the risk and spread. Environmental pollutants may have contributed to the rising global obesity rates. Some research reported associations between chemical pollutants and obesity, but findings are mixed. This study systematically examined associations between chemical pollutants and obesity in human subjects. METHODS: Systematic review of relevant studies published between 1 January 1995 and 1 June 2016 by searching PubMed and MEDLINE®. RESULTS: Thirty-five cross-sectional (n = 17) and cohort studies (n = 18) were identified that reported on associations between pollutants and obesity measures. Of them, 16 studies (45.71%) reported a positive association; none reported a sole inverse association; three (8.57%) reported a null association only; six (17.14%) reported both a positive and null association; seven (20.00%) reported a positive and inverse association; and three studies (8.57%) reported all associations (positive, inverse and null). Most studies examined the association between multiple different pollutants, different levels of concentration and in subsamples, which results in mixed results. Thirty-three studies reported at least one positive association between obesity and chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, biphenyl A, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene and more. Certain chemicals, such as biphenyl A, were more likely to have high ORs ranging from 1.0 to 3.0, whereas highly chlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls were more likely to have negative ORs. Effects of chemicals on the endocrine system and obesity might vary by substance, exposure level, measure of adiposity and subject characteristics (e.g. sex and age).

Reviews have been published in 1997 and 1998, where the evidence was found suggestive but not conclusive. An update of the current state of knowledge is warranted. Methods: A literature search has been conducted to identify and evaluate new research results on this topic issued between 1998 and 2004. Results: Eighteen new studies have been identified for this review. Collectively, the studies suggest an increase in the risk of different cancer types associated with exposure to pesticides. However, the evidence is conflicting with regard to cancer types as well as to causative factors across studies. The major shortcomings concern exposure assessment, where, e.g., ""farming"" is treated equal to ""exposure to pesticides,"" disregarding other possible exposures, e.g., to biological or infectious agents, and hitherto unidentified lifestyle factors. Also, many exposure questionnaires used in case-control studies are based on broad and sometimes implausible categories. In most studies exposures were categorized as ""ever vs. never,"" with no regard for exposure intensity or duration. Conclusions: The available literature does not allow firm conclusions with regard to pesticides and any type of childhood cancer. Investing in the acquisition and critical review of exposure information appears to be the crucial step for causal assessment in future research. However, focusing on the presence of pesticides, and not asking the question why they were used, might mask relevant associations to other causative agents. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",10.1007/s00420-006-0086-7,Pesticides,,

Further positive significant associations were found for history of anxiety or depression, pesticide exposure, head injury, rural living, beta-blockers, farming occupation, and well-water drinking, and negative significant associations were found for coffee drinking, hypertension, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, calcium channel blockers, and alcohol, but not for diabetes mellitus, cancer, oral contraceptive pill use, surgical menopause, hormone replacement therapy, statins, acetaminophen/paracetamol, aspirin, tea drinking, history of general anesthesia, or gastric ulcers. In the systematic review, additional associations included negative associations with raised serum urate, and single studies or studies with conflicting results. Interpretation: The strongest risk factors associated with later PD diagnosis are having a family history of PD or tremor, a history of constipation, and lack of smoking history. Further factors also but less strongly contribute to risk of PD diagnosis or, as some premotor symptoms, require further standardized studies to demonstrate the magnitude of risk associated with them.

Using PubMed searches, studies were identified that examined associations between preterm birth and exposure to five categories of environmental toxicants, including persistent organic pollutants, drinking-water contaminants, atmospheric pollutants, metals and metalloids, and other environmental contaminants. Individual studies were summarized and specific suggestions were made for future work in regard to exposure and outcome assessment methods as well as study design, with the recommendation of focusing on potential mediating toxicological mechanisms. In conclusion, no consistent evidence was found for positive associations between individual chemical exposures and preterm birth. By identifying limitations and addressing the gaps that may have impeded the ability to identify true associations thus far, this review can guide future epidemiologic studies of environmental exposures and preterm birth.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",10.1080/10937404.2013.775048,character(0),,

Pronounced increasing use trends were found for neonicotinoids, which exceeded their chronic RTLs, i.e., those of high relevance due to neonicotinoids̀ persistence in surface waters, for 56.8% of MICs (22.2% for acute RTLs). A regression analysis of insecticide use trends, although to be interpreted with care, indicated a future increase in applied amounts of several high risk insecticides such as pyrethroids and neonicotinoids, suggesting elevated prospective risks for U.S. surface waters, biodiversity, and endangered species.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",,Chemical;Ecosystem;Insecticides;United States;Prospective Studies;*Insecticides;*Water Pollutants;*Pyrethrins,,

Pesticide exposure is inevitable to the workers that use pesticides in their work. Exposure to pesticides is harmful to the workers’ health physically and mentally. The exposure to pesticides can be short-term, intermediate repeated, and long-term repeated via eye contact, inhalation, ingestion, dermal, or injection. The human health risk assessment method is endorsed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) intended to assess human health from exposures. Various types of pesticide exposure can increase the health risk. Thus, this study aimed to review the possible health risk occurred upon exposure to pesticides either directly or indirectly worldwide. Related works of the literature search were done using Science Direct, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Mendeley to review some articles related to the health risk of pesticides exposure which was published between the years 2002 to 2021. Respiratory cases and cancer have already been linked to pesticides exposure. The practical control measures are proper handling of pesticides and proper usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) to minimize or avoid the contact altogether. © 2021 UPM Press.

We systematically synthesized 40 years of data and developed a lipid database to test whether lipid-normalized POP concentrations are equal among tissues as expected under steady state for lipophilic compounds. Results supported equal partitioning among tissues with high blood flow or perfusion including the heart, kidney, muscle, and lung. Observed differences in the brain, fat, and blood plasma, however, suggest the physiological influence of the blood-brain barrier, limited perfusion, and protein content, respectively. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers partitioned comparably to legacy POPs. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, meanwhile, partitioned more into the lung, colon, and muscle compared to the liver under chronic and acute field exposure. Partitioning ratios of individual POPs among tissues were significantly related to the lipophilicity of compounds (as estimated by K(ow)) in half of the observed cases, and significant differences between juveniles and adults underscore physiological differences across life stages. The comprehensive tissue partitioning patterns presented here provide a quantitative basis to support comparative assessments of POP pollution derived from biomonitoring among multiple tissues.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: not conventional meta-analysis",10.1021/acs.est.1c02845,Animals;Chemical;Environmental Monitoring;Persistent Organic Pollutants;Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers/analysis;*Water Pollutants;*Polychlorinated Biphenyls;*Environmental Pollutants/analysis;*chemical partitioning;*diffusion limitation;*fugacity capacity;*lipophilicity;*maternal transfer;*pollution biomonitoring;*tissue affinity;*tissue physiology;*tissue residue;*Turtles,,

No association was found for congeners in groups I (potentially oestrogenic) and III (biologically persistent phenobarbital-type cytochrome P450 inducers), according to the classification proposed by Wolff and Toniolo, while less consistent results were reported for group II (potentially antioestrogenic and immunotoxic, dioxin-like). Two studies found a threefold risk of postmenopausal breast cancer for women with an A2455G base change in exon 7 of the polymorphic CYP1A1 gene (a member of the cytochrome P450 family) and high PCB levels, compared with women with two wild-type alleles and low PCB, based however on very few cases.

A comparison in PCBs contamination between Vietnam and other Asian countries was included. The status on PCBs contamination in Vietnam since participated as a party of the Stockholm convention on POPs in 2002 was also assessed. The results showed that Vietnam is facing serious PCBs contamination problems as it evidences the spread and accumulation of PCBs in the marine environment. The implementation of the Stockholm convention on POPs (PCBs in particular) has not yet demonstrated significant effect on the reduction in PCBs contamination in the environment.

Some commonly used pesticides possess neurotoxicity, and exposure to such compounds may trigger mechanisms similar to those in the development of idiopathic PD. We conducted a systematic review of epidemiological studies, aiming at a critical evaluation of the association between the development of PD and pesticide exposure. Reported effect sizes (ES) in the relevant studies were pooled into the meta-analysis to derive summary ES. The summary ES suggested a significantly positive association between PD and overall pesticide use (non-occupational and/or occupational pesticide use) [1.42; 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.32 to 1.52, the fixed-effects model], as well as between PD and occupational pesticide exposure (1.49 with a 95 CI of 1.34-1.66). Both occupational herbicide and occupational insecticide exposure showed a significant association with PD. The results of the meta-analysis reported in this study suggest the existence of a statistically positive association between PD and pesticide exposure. The majority of the studies that were pooled in the meta-analysis were case-control design with very few cohort studies and most with poor exposure characterization thus, any further case-control studies using similar methodologies are unlikely to have a significant impact or understanding on the currently-reported association between pesticide exposure and the development of idiopathic PD. Therefore, we believe that if further epidemiological studies are going to be conducted in the area, they should be prospective cohort studies that will include accurate exposure assessment. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

It has been postulated that exogenous toxicants, including pesticides, might be involved in the etiology of PD. In this article we present a comprehensive review: of the published epidemiologic and toxicologic literature and critically evaluate whether a relationship exists between pesticide exposure and PD. From the epidemiologic literature, there does appear to be a relatively consistent relationship between pesticide exposure and PD. This relationship appears strongest for exposure to herbicides and insecticides, and after long durations of exposure. Toxicologic data suggest that paraquat and rotenone may have neurotoxic actions that potentially play a role in the development of PD, with limited data for other pesticides. However, both the epidemiology and toxicology studies were limited by methodologic weaknesses. Particular issues of current and future interest include multiple exposures (both pesticides and other exogenous toxicants), developmental exposures, and gene-environment interactions. At present, the weight of evidence is sufficient to conclude that a generic association between pesticide exposure and PD exists but is insufficient for concluding that this is a causal relationship or that such a relationship exists for any particular pesticide compound or combined pesticide and other exogenous toxicant exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",10.1289/ehp.8095,Pesticides;Parkinson Disease,,

However, there is little clarity about the magnitude of the risk, nor about the specific agricultural exposures which contribute to the risk. METHODS: We have carried out a systematic review of case-control studies of multiple myeloma published from 1970 to October 2007. Studies were identified through database searches and from references in the literature.Studies reporting risk estimates from farming, agricultural exposures, and exposure to animals were identified, and details abstracted. The impact of study heterogeneity, publication bias, variation in methods of case identification and exposure ascertainment between studies were considered in analysis. RESULTS: Case control studies showed a pooled odds ratio (OR) for working as a farmer of 1.39 95% CI 1.18 to 1.65. There was no graphic evidence of publication bias, for pesticide exposure 1.47; 95% 1.11 to 1.94, for DDT 2.19; CI 95% 1.30 to 2.95; for exposed to herbicides 1.69; 95 %CI 1.01 to 1.83. For working on a farm for more than ten years OR was 1.87; 95% CI 1.15 to 3.16. CONCLUSION: Farmers seem to have increase risk for MM. However, a major limitation of this analysis is the presence of significant heterogeneity across the studies and the evidence of publication bias in some models.A pooled analysis using individual level data could provide more power and permit the harmonization of occupational and exposure coding data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: does not distinguish pesticides into chemical classes",,Multiple Myeloma,,

The IOM found sufficient evidence to conclude that the 2 environmental factors most strongly associated with breast cancer were exposure to ionizing radiation and to combined postmenopausal hormone therapy. The IOM's conclusion of a causal relation between radiation exposure and cancer is consistent with a large and varied literature showing that exposure to radiation in the same range as used for computed tomography will increase the risk of cancer.

We studied the association between prenatal exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyl 153 (PCB 153) and children's respiratory health in European birth cohorts. METHODS: We included 4608 mothers and children enrolled in 10 birth cohort studies from 7 European countries. Outcomes were parent-reported bronchitis and wheeze in the first 4 years of life. For each cohort, we performed Poisson regression analyses, modeling occurrences of the outcomes on the estimates of cord-serum concentrations of PCB 153 and DDE as continuous variables (per doubling exposure) and as cohort-specific tertiles. Summary estimates were obtained through random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: The risk of bronchitis or wheeze (combined variable) assessed before 18 months of age increased with increasing DDE exposure (relative risk [RR] per doubling exposure = 1.03 [95% confidence interval = 1.00-1.07]). When these outcomes were analyzed separately, associations appeared stronger for bronchitis. We also found an association between increasing PCB 153 exposure and bronchitis in this period (RR per doubling exposure = 1.06 [1.01-1.12]) but not between PCB 153 and wheeze. No associations were found between either DDE or PCB 153 and ever-wheeze assessed after 18 months. Inclusion of both compounds in the models attenuated risk estimates for PCB 153 tertiles of exposure, whereas DDE associations were more robust. CONCLUSION: This large meta-analysis suggests that prenatal DDE exposure may be associated with respiratory health symptoms in young children (below 18 months), whereas prenatal PCB 153 levels were not associated with such symptoms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Included"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",,Humans;Male;Cohort Studies;Female;Infant;Newborn;Pregnancy;Child;Preschool;Adult;Young Adult;Risk Factors;Adolescent;Poisson Distribution;Environmental Exposure/adverse effects;Bronchitis/chemically induced/epidemiology;Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene/*adverse effects;Europe/epidemiology;Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*adverse effects;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*chemically induced/epidemiology;Respiratory Sounds/etiology;Respiratory Tract Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology,,

This study was conducted to review and compile the results of the studies undertaken in the world which surveyed the organochlorine pesticides residue in breast milk. METHODS: A total of 710 national and international articles and texts related to the focused subject were extracted from the virtual databases using the following key words: Chlorinated pesticides, residue and breast milk. Thirty articles published between 1980 and 2013 were selected and reviewed. RESULTS: The majority of the reviewed articles indicated the presence of two or more organochlorine pesticides in the collected samples of breast milk. Based on the reviewed studies, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) had the highest level of concentration in the collected samples of breast milk. Moreover, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between mother's age, her multiparty and concentration of chlorinated pesticides in breast milk. CONCLUSION: The organochlorine pesticides are still applied in some developing countries including some regions of Iran. Thus, it seems essential to inform the community about the adverse effects of this class of pesticides; and most importantly the governments should also ban the use of such compounds.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",,"Pesticides;Human;Milk;Milk Ejection;Milk, Human",,

Concentrations of these contaminants in tissues of baleen whales are low. Sources of variation in organochlorine concentrations in whales include age, sex, region of exposure, and feeding habits. Concentrations of sigma DDT and PCBs in baleen whales appear higher in the northern hemisphere than in the southern oceans, perhaps due to greater contamination of northern ecosystems and a higher incidence of fish in the diet. However, maximum concentrations are generally lower in tissues of baleen whales than in other marine mammal species, both on global and local scales. This is predictable based on the general distribution, habitats and trophic levels of baleen whales. We reviewed laboratory studies on the effects of selected organochlorine contaminants on direct mortality and impaired reproduction in other mammals, and critically examined observations attempting to link organochlorines to reproductive and population effects in marine mammals. There is no firm basis to conclude that the contaminants reviewed herein have affected baleen whale populations. Although more information on contaminants in baleen whales would be of value, as a matter of priority, research and management actions should focus on reducing human-caused mortality and increasing habitat carrying capacity for these species.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",,Hydrocarbons;Male;Animals;Water Pollutants;Ecosystem;Female;Environmental Exposure;Conservation of Natural Resources;Metals/*analysis;Whales/*metabolism;Chemical/*analysis;Chlorinated/*analysis,,
rayyan-894980696,Environmental risk factors and health: An umbrella review of meta-analyses,2021,1,1,,16617827,18,2,,,,,,,"Background: Environmental health is a growing area of knowledge, continually increasing and updating the body of evidence linking the environment to human health. Aim: This study summarizes the epidemiological evidence on environmental risk factors from meta-analyses through an umbrella review. Methods: An umbrella review was conducted on meta-analyses of cohort, casecontrol, case-crossover, and time-series studies that evaluated the associations between environmental risk factors and health outcomes defined as incidence, prevalence, and mortality. The specific search strategy was designed in PubMed using free text and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms related to risk factors, environment, health outcomes, observational studies, and meta-analysis. The search was limited to English, Spanish, and French published articles and studies on humans. The search was conducted on September 20, 2020. Risk factors were defined as any attribute, characteristic, or exposure of an individual that increases the likelihood of developing a disease or death. The environment was defined as the external elements and conditions that surround, influence, and affect a human organism or population’s life and development. The environment definition included the physical environment such as nature, built environment, or pollution, but not the social environment. We excluded occupational exposures, microorganisms, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), behavioral risk factors, and no-natural disasters. Results: This umbrella review found 197 associations among 69 environmental exposures and 83 diseases and death causes reported in 103 publications. The environmental factors found in this review were air pollution, environmental tobacco smoke, heavy metals, chemicals, ambient temperature, noise, radiation, and urban residential surroundings. Among these, we identified 65 environmental exposures defined as risk factors and 4 environmental protective factors. In terms of study design, 57 included cohort and/or case-control studies, and 46 included time-series and/or case-crossover studies. In terms of the study population, 21 included children, and the rest included adult population and both sexes. In this review, the largest body of evidence was found in air pollution (91 associations among 14 air pollution definitions and 34 diseases and mortality diagnoses), followed by environmental tobacco smoke with 24 associations. Chemicals (including pesticides) were the third larger group of environmental exposures found among the meta-analyses included, with 19 associations. Conclusion: Environmental exposures are an important health determinant. This review provides an overview of an evolving research area and should be used as a complementary tool to understand the connections between the environment and human health. The evidence presented by this review should help to design public health interventions and the implementation of health in all policies approach aiming to improve populational health. © 2021 by the authors.

Maritime Antarctica is recipient of abundant snow precipitation. Snow scavenges air pollutants, and after snow melting, it can induce an unquantified and poorly understood amplification of concentrations of POPs. Air, snow, the fugacity in soils and snow, seawater and plankton were sampled concurrently from late spring to late summer at Livingston Island (Antarctica). Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) concentrations in snow and air were close to equilibrium. POPs in soils showed concentrations close to soil-air equilibrium or net volatilization depending on chemical volatility. Seawater-air fugacity ratios were highly correlated with the product of the snow-air partition coefficient and the Henry's law constant (K(SA) H'), a measure of snow amplification of fugacity. Therefore, coastal seawater mirrored the PCB congener profile and increased concentrations in snowmelt due to snowpack releasing POPs to seawater. The influence of snowpack and glacier inputs was further evidenced by the correlation between net volatilization fluxes of PCBs and seawater salinity. A meta-analysis of K(SA), estimated as the ratio of POP concentrations in snow and air from previously reported simultaneous field measurements, showed that snow amplification is relevant for diverse families of POPs, independent of their volatility. We claim that the potential impact of atmospheric pollution on aquatic ecosystems has been under-predicted by only considering air-water partitioning, as snow amplification influences, and may even control, the POP occurrence in cold environments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",,Environmental Monitoring;Ecosystem;Snow;Antarctic Regions;Islands;*Environmental Pollutants;*Polychlorinated Biphenyls;*Air Pollutants,,

Observational studies have shown a link between exposure to pesticides and the risk of PD. We performed this study to systemically review published case-control studies and estimate quantitatively the association between pesticide exposure and PD. We searched Medline (through PubMed) for eligible case-control studies. The association between pesticide exposure and PD risk or occurrence of certain genetic alterations, related to the pathogenesis of PD was presented as odds ratios (OR) and pooled under the random effects model, using the statistical add-in (MetaXL, version 5.0). The pooled result showed that exposure to pesticides is linked to PD (OR 1.46, 95% CI [1.21, 1.77]), but there was a significant heterogeneity among included studies. Exposure to pesticides increased the risk of alterations in different PD pathogenesis-related genes, such as GST (OR 1.97, 95% CI [1.41, 2.76]), PON-1 (OR 1.32, 95% CI [1.09, 1.6]), MDR1 (OR 2.06, 95% CI [1.58, 2.68]), and SNCA genes (OR 1.28, 95% CI [1.02, 1.37]). There was no statistically significant association between exposure to pesticides and alteration of CYP2D6 (OR 1.19, 95% CI [0.91, 1.54]), SLC6A3 (OR 0.74, 95% CI [0.55, 1]), MnSOD (OR 1.45, 95% CI [0.97, 2.16]), NQO1 (OR 1.35, 95% CI [0.91, 2.01]), and PON-2 genes (OR 0.88, 95% CI [0.53, 1.45]). In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence that pesticide exposure is significantly associated with the risk of PD and alterations in genes involved in PD pathogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism of this association and the effect of the duration of exposure or the type of pesticides should be addressed by future research. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.biopha.2017.03.100,Pesticides;Parkinson Disease,,

METHODS: A search of the MEDLINE and Embase databases was conducted in October 2015. Eligibility criteria included examining hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or primary liver cancer, pesticides as an exposure of interest, and individual-level incidence. The review was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Forty-eight papers were assessed for eligibility and 15 studies were included in the review. The majority of studies were conducted in China and Egypt (n = 8), used a case-control design (n = 14), and examined HCC (n = 14). Most studies showed no association between self-reported and/or occupational exposure to pesticides and liver cancer risk. Six studies demonstrated statistically significant positive associations, including three biomarker-based studies (two using pre-diagnostic sera) that reported higher serum levels of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) were associated with increased HCC risk. Studies indirectly measuring pesticide exposure using self-reported exposure, occupation, job-exposure matrices, or geographic residence demonstrated inconsistent results. These studies were limited by exposure assessment methods, lack of confounder information, minimal case confirmation, selection bias, and/or over-adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: There is mixed evidence suggesting a possible association between specific pesticides and HCC risk, with the strongest evidence observed in biomarker-based studies. In particular, organochlorine pesticides, including DDT, may increase HCC risk. Future research should focus on improved pesticide exposure assessment methods, potentially incorporating multiple approaches including biomonitoring while considering the chemicals of interest, historical exposure to address latency periods, and examining specific chemicals and exposure pathways.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",,Humans;Pesticides;Liver;Carcinoma;Liver Neoplasms;Environmental Exposure/adverse effects;Pesticides/*adverse effects;Biomarkers/blood;China/epidemiology;DDT/blood;Egypt/epidemiology;Liver Neoplasms/*epidemiology;Occupational Exposure/adverse effects;Hepatocellular/*epidemiology,,

The etiology of preterm birth has not yet been elucidated. Although maternal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase the risk for preterm birth, associations have not been confirmed. We performed a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationships between maternal exposure to EDCs and preterm birth. A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid-EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies providing quantitative data on the association between maternal EDC exposure and preterm birth in humans was conducted in July 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. A total of 59 studies were included. The pooled results indicated that maternal exposure to metals (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.29) and phthalates (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.42) was related to an increased risk for preterm birth. Specifically, maternal exposure to lead, cadmium, chromium, copper and manganese appeared to be correlated with an elevated risk for preterm birth. Additionally, maternal exposure to monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was also associated with preterm birth. In conclusion, maternal exposure to metals and phthalates may increase the risk for preterm birth based on current evidence. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Lorenzo""=>""Maybe"", ""z5393783""=>""Maybe""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""z5393783""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118264,Maternal Exposure;Regression Analysis,,

It was found that there is an increasing production of articles in this research area. The H-index of our data set was 11, with an average of 13.72 citations per item. The leader country in this research area was India, followed by Turkey and Brazil. The best cited research area was “Environmental Sciences” and “Environmental Sciences and Ecology,” followed by “Cell Biology.” The most used keywords were genotoxicity, pesticides, and insecticide. The meta-analytical test showed that the number of micronuclei found in onion cells treated with insecticides is higher than that in untreated ones, and the use of pesticides reduced the mitotic index.

Resultantly, extensive use of POPs is causing vigorous deterioration of environment and human health. The current study addresses: (1) the general information on associated ecological effects and toxicity assessment by meta-analysis for local fauna and flora (2) their respective occurrence in living organisms; and (3) sources and distribution patterns of various POPs classes in environmental compartments of Pakistan. Based on the study, it can be concluded that the environment of Pakistan is highly contaminated with organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), dechlorane plus (DP), and polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), which is further supported with the meta-analysis. Nevertheless, unavailability of environmental quality standards and food safety for POPs render it a forthcoming challenge of multicompartment toxicity exposure. Therefore, strategies must be planned for risk assessment of biologically active POPs, while the POP waste inventory should be elevated, along with the necessary measures to promote appropriate handling and treatment of POP as a matter of prime importance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5393783""=>""Maybe"", ""Coralie""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""z5393783""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: no meta-analysis | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no meta-analysis",10.1080/10807039.2017.1292843,Oxidative Stress;Pakistan,,
